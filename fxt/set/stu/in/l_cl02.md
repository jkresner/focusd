(a)  the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,
(b)  the likely seriousness of the harm,
(c)  the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,
(d)  the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.


#### 5C   Other principles
In proceedings relating to liability for negligence:
(a)  the burden of taking precautions to avoid a risk of harm includes the burden of taking precautions to avoid similar risks of harm for which the person may be responsible, and
(b)  the fact that a risk of harm could have been avoided by doing something in a different way does not of itself give rise to or affect liability for the way in which the thing was done, and
(c)  the subsequent taking of action that would (had the action been taken earlier) have avoided a risk of harm does not of itself give rise to or affect liability in respect of the risk and does not of itself constitute an admission of liability in connection with the risk.


Division 3 Causation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### 5D   General principles
(1)  A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises the following elements:
(a)  that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and
(b)  that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person’s liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability).
(2)  In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.
(3)  If it is relevant to the determination of factual causation to determine what the person who suffered harm would have done if the negligent person had not been negligent:
(a)  the matter is to be determined subjectively in the light of all relevant circumstances, subject to paragraph (b), and
(b)  any statement made by the person after suffering the harm about what he or she would have done is inadmissible except to the extent (if any) that the statement is against his or her interest.
(4)  For the purpose of determining the scope of liability, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.


#### 5E   Onus of proof
In proceedings relating to liability for negligence, the plaintiff always bears the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, any fact relevant to the issue of causation.
Division 4 Assumption of risk


#### 5F   Meaning of “obvious risk”
(1)  For the purposes of this Division, an obvious risk to a person who suffers harm is a risk that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person.
(2)  Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common knowledge.
(3)  A risk of something occurring can be an obvious risk even though it has a low probability of occurring.
(4)  A risk can be an obvious risk even if the risk (or a condition or circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable.


#### 5G   Injured persons presumed to be aware of obvious risks
(1)  In proceedings relating to liability for negligence, a person who suffers harm is presumed to have been aware of the risk of harm if it was an obvious risk, unless the person proves on the balance of probabilities that he or she was not aware of the risk.
(2)  For the purposes of this section, a person is aware of a risk if the person is aware of the type or kind of risk, even if the person is not aware of the precise nature, extent or manner of occurrence of the risk.


#### 5H   No proactive duty to warn of obvious risk
(1)  A person (the defendant) does not owe a duty of care to another person (the plaintiff) to warn of an obvious risk to the plaintiff.
(2)  This section does not apply if:
(a)  the plaintiff has requested advice or information about the risk from the defendant, or
(b)  the defendant is required by a written law to warn the plaintiff of the risk, or
(c)  the defendant is a professional and the risk is a risk of the death of or personal injury to the plaintiff from the provision of a professional service by the defendant.
(3)  Subsection (2) does not give rise to a presumption of a duty to warn of a risk in the circumstances referred to in that subsection.


#### 5I   No liability for materialisation of inherent risk
(1)  A person is not liable in negligence for harm suffered by another person as a result of the materialisation of an inherent risk.
(2)  An inherent risk is a risk of something occurring that cannot be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care and skill.
(3)  This section does not operate to exclude liability in connection with a duty to warn of a risk.
Division 5 Recreational activities


#### 5J   Application of Division
(1)  This Division applies only in respect of liability in negligence for harm to a person (the plaintiff) resulting from a recreational activity engaged in by the plaintiff.
(2)  This Division does not limit the operation of Division 4 in respect of a recreational activity.


#### 5K   Definitions
In this Division:
dangerous recreational activity means a recreational activity that involves a significant risk of physical harm.
obvious risk has the same meaning as it has in Division 4.
recreational activity includes:
(a)  any sport (whether or not the sport is an organised activity), and
(b)  any pursuit or activity engaged in for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure, and
(c)  any pursuit or activity engaged in at a place (such as a beach, park or other public open space) where people ordinarily engage in sport or in any pursuit or activity for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure.


#### 5L   No liability for harm suffered from obvious risks of dangerous recreational activities
(1)  A person (the defendant) is not liable in negligence for harm suffered by another person (the plaintiff) as a result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity engaged in by the plaintiff.
(2)  This section applies whether or not the plaintiff was aware of the risk.


#### 5M   No duty of care for recreational activity where risk warning
(1)  A person (the defendant) does not owe a duty of care to another person who engages in a recreational activity (the plaintiff) to take care in respect of a risk of the activity if the risk was the subject of a risk warning to the plaintiff.
(2)  If the person who suffers harm is an incapable person, the defendant may rely on a risk warning only if:
(a)  the incapable person was under the control of or accompanied by another person (who is not an incapable person and not the defendant) and the risk was the subject of a risk warning to that other person, or
(b)  the risk was the subject of a risk warning to a parent of the incapable person (whether or not the incapable person was under the control of or accompanied by the parent).
(3)  For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), a risk warning to a person in relation to a recreational activity is a warning that is given in a manner that is reasonably likely to result in people being warned of the risk before engaging in the recreational activity. The defendant is not required to establish that the person received or understood the warning or was capable of receiving or understanding the warning.
(4)  A risk warning can be given orally or in writing (including by means of a sign or otherwise).
(5)  A risk warning need not be specific to the particular risk and can be a general warning of risks that include the particular risk concerned (so long as the risk warning warns of the general nature of the particular risk).
(6)  A defendant is not entitled to rely on a risk warning unless it is given by or on behalf of the defendant or by or on behalf of the occupier of the place where the recreational activity is engaged in.
(7)  A defendant is not entitled to rely on a risk warning if it is established (on the balance of probabilities) that the harm concerned resulted from a contravention of a provision of a written law of the State or Commonwealth that establishes specific practices or procedures for the protection of personal safety.
(8)  A defendant is not entitled to rely on a risk warning to a person to the extent that the warning was contradicted by any representation as to risk made by or on behalf of the defendant to the person.
(9)  A defendant is not entitled to rely on a risk warning if the plaintiff was required to engage in the recreational activity by the defendant.
(10)  The fact that a risk is the subject of a risk warning does not of itself mean:
(a)  that the risk is not an obvious or inherent risk of an activity, or
(b)  that a person who gives the risk warning owes a duty of care to a person who engages in an activity to take precautions to avoid the risk of harm from the activity.
(11)  This section does not limit or otherwise affect the effect of a risk warning in respect of a risk of an activity that is not a recreational activity.
(12)  In this section:
incapable person means a person who, because of the person’s young age or a physical or mental disability, lacks the capacity to understand the risk warning.
parent of an incapable person means any person (not being an incapable person) having parental responsibility for the incapable person.


#### 5N   Waiver of contractual duty of care for recreational activities
(1)  Despite any other written or unwritten law, a term of a contract for the supply of recreation services may exclude, restrict or modify any liability to which this Division applies that results from breach of an express or implied warranty that the services will be rendered with reasonable care and skill.
(2)  Nothing in the written law of New South Wales renders such a term of a contract void or unenforceable or authorises any court to refuse to enforce the term, to declare the term void or to vary the term.
(3)  A term of a contract for the supply of recreation services that is to the effect that a person to whom recreation services are supplied under the contract engages in any recreational activity concerned at his or her own risk operates to exclude any liability to which this Division applies that results from breach of an express or implied warranty that the services will be rendered with reasonable care and skill.
(4)  In this section, recreation services means services supplied to a person for the purposes of, in connection with or incidental to the pursuit by the person of any recreational activity.
(5)  This section applies in respect of a contract for the supply of services entered into before or after the commencement of this section but does not apply in respect of a breach of warranty that occurred before that commencement.
(6)  This section does not apply if it is established (on the balance of probabilities) that the harm concerned resulted from a contravention of a provision of a written law of the State or Commonwealth that establishes specific practices or procedures for the protection of personal safety.
Division 6 Professional negligence


#### 5O   Standard of care for professionals
(1)  A person practising a profession (a professional) does not incur a liability in negligence arising from the provision of a professional service if it is established that the professional acted in a manner that (at the time the service was provided) was widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice.
(2)  However, peer professional opinion cannot be relied on for the purposes of this section if the court considers that the opinion is irrational.
(3)  The fact that there are differing peer professional opinions widely accepted in Australia concerning a matter does not prevent any one or more (or all) of those opinions being relied on for the purposes of this section.
(4)  Peer professional opinion does not have to be universally accepted to be considered widely accepted.
5P   Division does not apply to duty to warn of risk
This Division does not apply to liability arising in connection with the giving of (or the failure to give) a warning, advice or other information in respect of the risk of death of or injury to a person associated with the provision by a professional of a professional service.


Division 7 Non-delegable duties and vicarious liability
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### 5Q   Liability based on non-delegable duty
(1)  The extent of liability in tort of a person (the defendant) for breach of a non-delegable duty to ensure that reasonable care is taken by a person in the carrying out of any work or task delegated or otherwise entrusted to the person by the defendant is to be determined as if the liability were the vicarious liability of the defendant for the negligence of the person in connection with the performance of the work or task.
(2)  This section applies to an action in tort whether or not it is an action in negligence, despite anything to the contrary in section 5A.
Division 8 Contributory negligence


#### 5R   Standard of contributory negligence
(1)  The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm.
(2)  For that purpose:
(a)  the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and
(b)  the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time.


#### 5S   Contributory negligence can defeat claim
In determining the extent of a reduction in damages by reason of contributory negligence, a court may determine a reduction of 100% if the court thinks it just and equitable to do so, with the result that the claim for damages is defeated.


#### 5T   Contributory negligence—claims under the Compensation to Relatives Act 1897
(1)  In a claim for damages brought under the Compensation to Relatives Act 1897, the court is entitled to have regard to the contributory negligence of the deceased person.
(2)  Section 13 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 does not apply so as to prevent the reduction of damages by the contributory negligence of a deceased person in respect of a claim for damages brought under the Compensation to Relatives Act 1897.
6–8   (Repealed)

An organisation and any successor of that organisation are, for the purposes of this Part, taken to be the same organisation.
Division 2 Duty of organisations to prevent child abuse


#### 6D   Organisations that are responsible for a child
In this Division:
(a)  an organisation is responsible for a child if it (including any part of it) exercises care, supervision or authority over the child (or purports to do so or is obliged by law to do so), and
(b)  if an organisation (including any part of it) delegates the exercise of care, supervision or authority over a child to another organisation (in whole or in part), each organisation is responsible for the child.

(a)  authority, power or control over the child,
(b)  the trust of the child,

(a)  the amount per week comprising the amount estimated by the Australian Statistician as the average weekly total earnings of all employees in New South Wales for the most recent quarter occurring before the date of the award for which such an amount has been estimated by the Australian Statistician and that is, at that date, available to the court making the award, or
(b)  if the Australian Statistician fails or ceases to estimate the amount referred to in paragraph (a), the prescribed amount or the amount determined in such manner or by reference to such matters, or both, as may be prescribed.


#### 13   Future economic loss—claimant’s prospects and adjustments
(1)  A court cannot make an award of damages for future economic loss unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant’s most likely future circumstances but for the injury.
(2)  When a court determines the amount of any such award of damages for future economic loss it is required to adjust the amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions by reference to the percentage possibility that the events might have occurred but for the injury.
(3)  If the court makes an award for future economic loss, it is required to state the assumptions on which the award was based and the relevant percentage by which damages were adjusted.


#### 14   Damages for future economic loss—discount rate
(1)  If an award of damages is to include any component, assessed as a lump sum, for future economic loss of any kind, the present value of that future economic loss is to be determined by adopting the prescribed discount rate.
(2)  The prescribed discount rate is:
(a)  a discount rate of the percentage prescribed by the regulations, or
(b)  if no percentage is so prescribed—a discount rate of 5%.
(3)  Except as provided by this section, nothing in this section affects any other law relating to the discounting of sums awarded as damages.

(1) Definitions In this section:
assisted care, in relation to a dependant of a claimant, means any of the following kinds of care (whether or not the care is provided gratuitously):
(a)  any respite care (being care that includes accommodation that is provided by a person other than the claimant to a dependant who is aged or frail, or who suffers from a physical or mental disability, with the primary purpose of giving the dependant or claimant, or both, a break from their usual care arrangements),
(b)  if the dependant is a minor (but without limiting paragraph (a))—any care that is provided to the dependant by a person other than the claimant where:
(i)  the person is a parent of the dependant (whether derived through paragraph (a) (i) or (ii) of the definition of dependants in this subsection, adoption or otherwise), and
(ii)  the care includes the provision of accommodation to the dependant.
dependants, in relation to a claimant, means:
(a)  such of the following persons as are wholly or partly dependent on the claimant at the time that the liability in respect of which the claim is made arises:

gratuitous domestic services means services of a domestic nature for which the person providing the service has not been paid or is not liable to be paid.
(2) When damages may be awarded Damages may be awarded to a claimant for any loss of the claimant’s capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services to the claimant’s dependants, but only if the court is satisfied that:
(a)  in the case of any dependants of the claimant of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of dependants in subsection (1)—the claimant provided the services to those dependants before the time that the liability in respect of which the claim is made arose, and
(b)  the claimant’s dependants were not (or will not be) capable of performing the services themselves by reason of their age or physical or mental incapacity, and
(c)  there is a reasonable expectation that, but for the injury to which the damages relate, the claimant would have provided the services to the claimant’s dependants:
(i)  for at least 6 hours per week, and
(ii)  for a period of at least 6 consecutive months, and
(d)  there will be a need for the services to be provided for those hours per week and that consecutive period of time and that need is reasonable in all the circumstances.
Note. Section 18 provides that a court cannot order the payment of interest on damages awarded for any loss of capacity of a claimant to provide gratuitous domestic services to the claimant’s dependants.
(3)  If a dependant of the claimant received (or will receive) assisted care during the 6-month period referred to in subsection (2) (c) (ii) and the court is satisfied that the periods of that care were (or will be) short-term and occasional, the court may:
(a)  in determining whether the claimant would have provided gratuitous domestic services to the dependant during a particular week for at least the 6 hours referred to in subsection (2) (c) (i), disregard the week if assisted care was (or will be) provided during that week, and
(b)  in determining whether the claimant would have provided gratuitous domestic services to the dependant during the 6-month period referred to in subsection (2) (c) (ii), disregard any periods during which the assisted care was (or will be) provided in that 6-month period,
but only if the total number of weeks in which the care was (or will be) provided during the 6-month period does not exceed 4 weeks in total.
(4) Determination of amount of damages The amount of damages that may be awarded for any loss of the claimant’s capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services must not exceed the amount calculated at the same hourly rate as that provided by section 15 (5) regardless of the number of hours involved.
(5)  In determining the amount of damages (if any) to be awarded to a claimant for any loss of the claimant’s capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services to the claimant’s dependants, a court:
(a)  may only award damages for that loss in accordance with the provisions of this section, and
(b)  must not include in any damages awarded to the claimant for non-economic loss a component that compensates the claimant for the loss of that capacity.
(6) Circumstances when damages may not be awarded The claimant (or the legal personal representative of a deceased claimant) may not be awarded damages for any loss of the claimant’s capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services to any dependant of the claimant if the dependant has previously recovered damages in respect of that loss of capacity.
(7)  A person (including a dependant of a claimant) may not be awarded damages for a loss sustained by the person by reason of the claimant’s loss of capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services if the claimant (or the legal personal representative of a deceased claimant) has previously recovered damages in respect of that loss of capacity.
(8)  If a claimant is a participant in the Scheme under the Motor Accidents (Lifetime Care and Support) Act 2006, damages may not be awarded to the claimant under this section in respect of any loss of the claimant’s capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services to the claimant’s dependants while the claimant is a participant in the Scheme if (and to the extent that):
(a)  the loss resulted from the motor accident injury (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of which the claimant is a participant in that Scheme, and
(b)  the treatment and care needs (within the meaning of that Act) of the claimant that are provided for or are to be provided under the Scheme include the provision of such domestic services to the claimant’s dependants.
(9)  Damages may not be awarded to a claimant under this section in respect of any loss of the claimant’s capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services to the claimant’s dependants if (and to the extent that):
(a)  the loss resulted from an injury caused by a motor accident (within the meaning of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999), and
(b)  an insurer has made, or is liable to make, payments to or on behalf of the claimant for such services under section 83 (Duty of insurer to make hospital, medical and other payments) of that Act.
(10) Damages may not be awarded if they can be recovered as damages for attendant care services Damages may not be awarded to a claimant under this section in respect of any loss of the claimant’s capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services to the claimant’s dependants if (and to the extent that):
(a)  the claimant could recover damages for gratuitous attendant care services (within the meaning of section 15) in respect of the same injury that caused the loss, and
(b)  the provision of such attendant care services to the claimant also resulted (or would also result) in the claimant’s dependants being provided with the domestic services that the claimant has lost the capacity to provide.
(11) Determining value of gratuitous domestic services In determining the value of any gratuitous domestic services that a claimant has lost the capacity to provide, the court must take into account:
(a)  the extent of the claimant’s capacity to provide the services before the claimant sustained the injury that is the subject of the claim, and
(b)  the extent to which provision of the services would, but for the injury sustained by the claimant, have also benefited persons in respect of whom damages could not be awarded under subsection (2), and
(c)  the vicissitudes or contingencies of life for which allowance is ordinarily made in the assessment of damages.


#### 15C   Damages for loss of superannuation entitlements

Division 3 Fixing damages for non-economic loss (general damages)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### 16   Determination of damages for non-economic loss
(1)  No damages may be awarded for non-economic loss unless the severity of the non-economic loss is at least 15% of a most extreme case.
(2)  The maximum amount of damages that may be awarded for non-economic loss is $350,000, but the maximum amount is to be awarded only in a most extreme case.
(3)  If the severity of the non-economic loss is equal to or greater than 15% of a most extreme case, the damages for non-economic loss are to be determined in accordance with the following Table:
Table
Severity of the non-economic loss (as a proportion of a most extreme case)
Damages for non-economic loss (as a proportion of the maximum amount that may be awarded for non-economic loss)

34%–100% respectively
(4)  An amount determined in accordance with subsection (3) is to be rounded to the nearest $500 (with the amounts of $250 and $750 being rounded up).
Note. The following are the steps required in the assessment of non-economic loss in accordance with this section:
Step 1: Determine the severity of the claimant’s non-economic loss as a proportion of a most extreme case. The proportion should be expressed as a percentage.
Step 2: Confirm the maximum amount that may be awarded under this section for non-economic loss in a most extreme case. This amount is indexed each year under section 17.
Step 3: Use the Table to determine the percentage of the maximum amount payable in respect of the claim. The amount payable under this section for non-economic loss is then determined by multiplying the maximum amount that may be awarded in a most extreme case by the percentage set out in the Table.
Where the proportion of a most extreme case is greater than 33%, the amount payable will be the same proportion of the maximum amount.


#### 17   Indexation of maximum amount relating to non-economic loss
(1)  The Minister is, on or before 1 October 2002 and on or before 1 October in each succeeding year, to declare, by order published on the NSW legislation website, the amount that is to apply, as from the date specified in the order, for the purposes of section 16 (2).
(2)  The amount declared is to be the amount applicable under section 16 (2) (or that amount as last adjusted under this section) adjusted by the percentage change in the amount estimated by the Australian Statistician of the average weekly total earnings of full-time adults in New South Wales over the 4 quarters preceding the date of the declaration for which those estimates are, at that date, available.
(3)  An amount declared for the time being under this section applies to the exclusion of the amount under section 16 (2).
(4)  If the Australian Statistician fails or ceases to estimate the amount referred to in subsection (2), the amount declared is to be determined in accordance with the regulations.
(5)  In adjusting an amount to be declared for the purposes of section 16 (2), the amount determined in accordance with subsection (2) is to be rounded to the nearest $500 (with the amounts of $250 and $750 being rounded up).
(6)  A declaration made or published on the NSW legislation website after 1 October in a year and specifying a date that is before the date it is made or published as the date from which the amount declared by the order is to apply has effect as from that specified date.


#### 17A   Tariffs for damages for non-economic loss
(1)  In determining damages for non-economic loss, a court may refer to earlier decisions of that or other courts for the purpose of establishing the appropriate award in the proceedings.
(2)  For that purpose, the parties to the proceedings or their Australian legal practitioner may bring the court’s attention to awards of damages for non-economic loss in those earlier decisions.
(3)  This section does not alter the rules for the determination of other damages.


Division 4 Interest on damages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### 18   Interest on damages
(1)  A court cannot order the payment of interest on damages awarded for any of the following:
(a)  non-economic loss,
(b)  gratuitous attendant care services as defined in section 15 (other than gratuitous attendant care services to which section 15A applies),
(c)  loss of a claimant’s capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services to the claimant’s dependants (as provided by section 15B).
(2)  If a court is satisfied that interest is payable on damages (other than damages in respect of which a court cannot order the payment of interest under subsection (1)), the amount of interest is to be calculated:
(a)  for the period from when the loss to which the damages relate was first incurred until the date on which the court determines the damages, and
(b)  in accordance with the principles ordinarily applied by the court for that purpose, subject to subsection (3).
(3)  The rate of interest to be used in any such calculation is:
(a)  such interest rate as may be determined by the regulations, or
(b)  if no such rate is determined by the regulations—the relevant interest rate as at the date of determination of the damages.
(4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the relevant interest rate is the rate representing the Commonwealth Government 10-year benchmark bond rate as published by the Reserve Bank of Australia in the Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin (however described) and as applying:
(a)  on the first business day of January of each year (in which case the rate is to apply as the relevant interest rate for the period from 1 March until 31 August of that year), or
(b)  on the first business day of July of each year (in which case the rate is to apply as the relevant interest rate for the period from 1 September of that year until the last day of February of the following year).
(5)  Nothing in this section affects the payment of interest on a debt under a judgment or order of a court.


Division 5 Third party contributions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### 19   Third party contributions
(1)  This section applies when a person (the claimant) is entitled to an award of damages in respect of death or injury against a person (the defendant) and also against another person (the third party), and the award against the defendant is an award to which this Part applies but the award against the third party is not an award to which this Part applies.
(2)  A court determining the amount of the contribution (the defendant’s contribution) to be recovered by the third party from the defendant must:
(a)  determine the defendant’s contribution as a percentage, being such percentage as the court thinks just and equitable (having regard to the extent of the responsibility of the defendant and the third party, respectively, for the claimant’s damages), and
(b)  determine the amount of damages to which the claimant is, or would be, entitled in accordance with this Part (as if the award of damages against the third party were not excluded from the operation of this Part), and
(c)  fix the amount of the defendant’s contribution by applying the percentage determined under paragraph (a) to the amount of damages determined under paragraph (b).
(3)  The amount of damages that may be recovered by the claimant from the third party is to be reduced by the difference between:
(a)  the amount of the contribution to which the third party would have been entitled (but for this section) from the defendant, and
(b)  the amount of the defendant’s contribution calculated under subsection (2).
(4)  Subsection (3) does not limit any greater reduction (applicable under any other law, including any other Part of this Act) in the amount of damages that may be recovered by the claimant from the third party.


#### 20   (Repealed)
Division 6 Exemplary and similar damages


#### 21   Limitation on exemplary, punitive and aggravated damages
In an action for the award of personal injury damages where the act or omission that caused the injury or death was negligence, a court cannot award exemplary or punitive damages or damages in the nature of aggravated damages.

Division 7 Structured settlements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 22   What is a structured settlement
For the purposes of this Division, a structured settlement is an agreement that provides for the payment of all or part of an award of damages in the form of periodic payments funded by an annuity or other agreed means.


#### 23   Court required to inform parties of proposed award
(1)  The purpose of this section is to enable the court to give the parties to proceedings a reasonable opportunity to negotiate a structured settlement.
(2)  A court that decides to make an award of personal injury damages in respect of future loss (not including interest) exceeding $100,000 must first notify all the parties to the proceedings of the terms of the award it proposes to make.
(3)  In addition, if the court considers that the person may be a person in need of protection, the court is to notify the NSW Trustee and Guardian of the terms of the award it proposes to make.
(4)  The notification must set out the amount of each component part of the proposed award in accordance with the requirements of the regulations and rules of court.
(5)  In this section:
person in need of protection means a person who is liable to be subject to an order that the estate of the person be subject to management under the NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009 because the person is not capable of managing his or her own affairs.


#### 24   Court may make consent order for structured settlement
A court may, on the application of the parties to a claim for personal injury damages, make an order approving of or in the terms of a structured settlement even though the payment of damages is not in the form of a lump sum award of damages.


#### 25   Obligation of Australian legal practitioners to provide advice
An Australian legal practitioner must advise, in writing, a plaintiff who proposes to negotiate a settlement of a claim for personal injury damages about the following:
(a)  the availability of structured settlements,
(b)  the desirability of the plaintiff obtaining independent financial advice about structured settlements and lump sum settlements of the claim.


#### 26   Offer of structured settlement—legal costs
(1)  Clause 5 of Schedule 1 to the Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014 extends to an offer of compromise by way of a structured settlement on a claim for personal injury damages.
(2)  In that case, the court is to have regard to the cost to the defendant of the proposed structured settlement as compared to the lump sum payment of damages when determining whether a reasonable offer of compromise has been made.

(1)  The degree of permanent impairment that results from an injury is to be assessed as provided by this Part and Part 7 (Medical assessment) of Chapter 7 of the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998 (the 1998 WC Act).
(2)  Part 7 of Chapter 7 of the 1998 WC Act extends to an assessment of degree of permanent impairment for the purposes of this Part and for that purpose applies as if:
(a)  an assessment under this Part were an assessment under and for the purposes of that Part of the 1998 WC Act, and
(b)  a reference in that Part of the 1998 WC Act to a worker were a reference to an offender, and
(c)  a reference in that Part of the 1998 WC Act to a worker’s employer were a reference to the Crown, and
(d)  section 330 (Costs of medical assessment) of the 1998 WC Act were omitted from that Part, and
(e)  a reference in that Part to the WorkCover Guidelines were a reference to guidelines issued under subsection (2A), and
(f)  the provisions of that Part applied with such other modifications as may be prescribed by the regulations.
(2A)  The Minister administering the CAS Act may, by order published in the Gazette, issue guidelines for the purposes of the application of Part 7 of Chapter 7 of the 1998 WC Act to offenders in respect of the same kinds of matters for which the WorkCover Guidelines may make provision for the purposes of that Part.
Note. The Minister may amend or repeal an order made under this subsection. See section 43 of the Interpretation Act 1987.
(2B)  Without limiting subsection (2A), an order made under that subsection may apply, adopt or incorporate (whether wholly or in part or with or without modifications) the provisions of the WorkCover Guidelines, either as published or as in force from time to time.
(2C)  Sections 40 (Notice of statutory rules to be tabled) and 41 (Disallowance of statutory rules) of the Interpretation Act 1987 apply to an order made under subsection (2A) in the same way as they apply to a statutory rule.
(3)  If there is a dispute about the degree of permanent impairment of an injured offender, a court may not award damages unless the degree of permanent impairment has been assessed by an approved medical specialist in accordance with the 1998 WC Act.
(3A)  A dispute about the degree of permanent impairment of an injured offender cannot be referred for assessment unless the offender has provided the protected defendant with a medical report by a medical practitioner that assesses that the degree of permanent impairment of the injured offender is at least 15% and sets out the medical practitioner’s reasons for that assessment.
(4)  A court may, at any stage in proceedings on a claim for damages, refer the matter for assessment of the degree of permanent impairment by an approved medical specialist in accordance with the 1998 WC Act.
(5)  Section 151H (No damages unless permanent impairment of at least 15%) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 applies for the purposes of an assessment under this Part of whether the degree of permanent impairment resulting from an injury is at least 15%.
(6)  In this section:
modification includes an addition, omission or substitution.
WorkCover Guidelines has the same meaning as it has in the 1998 WC Act.
Division 3 Damages for economic loss


#### 26E   Damages for past or future loss of earnings
(1)  This section applies to an award of damages:
(a)  for past economic loss due to loss of earnings or the deprivation or impairment of earning capacity, or
(b)  for future economic loss due to the deprivation or impairment of earning capacity.
(2)  In awarding damages, the court is to disregard the amount (if any) by which the injured or deceased offender’s net weekly earnings would (but for the injury or death) have exceeded the amount that is the maximum amount of weekly payments of compensation under section 35 of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (even though that maximum amount under that section is a maximum gross earnings amount).
(3)  The maximum amount of weekly payments of compensation under section 35 of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 for a future period is to be the amount that the court considers is likely to be the amount for that period having regard to the operation of Division 6 (Indexation of amounts of benefits) of Part 3 of that Act.


#### 26F   Retirement age
In awarding damages for future economic loss due to deprivation or impairment of earning capacity, the court is to disregard any earning capacity of the injured offender after age 65.


#### 26G   Future economic loss—assumption about release on parole
In making an assessment for the purposes of an award for future economic loss about future earning capacity or other events on which an award is to be based in respect of an offender eligible for release on parole, a court is to assume that the offender is likely to be released when the offender becomes eligible for release on parole.
Division 4 Damages for non-economic loss


#### 26H   Restriction on damages for non-economic loss
A court is not to award damages for non-economic loss except as permitted by this Division.
26I   Non-economic loss damages limited to workers compensation amount
(1)  A court may award damages for non-economic loss up to a maximum of the total amount to which a worker would be entitled as compensation under Division 4 (Compensation for non-economic loss) of Part 3 of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 if the worker had received an injury that entitled the worker to compensation under that Act and that resulted in a degree of permanent impairment that is the same as the offender’s degree of permanent impairment.
(2)  When determining the total amount to which a worker would be entitled as compensation under a provision of the Workers Compensation Act 1987, the amount is to be determined under the provision as it was in force when the injury to the offender was received.
Division 5 Victims support payments owed by offender


#### 26J   Authority for deduction from damages
(1)  A protected defendant who is liable to pay damages to an offender pursuant to an award to which this Part applies is entitled to deduct from those damages the amount of any victim support payment required to be paid by the offender.
(2)  A victim support payment is an amount ordered to be paid by the offender by an order for restitution under Division 2 of Part 5 of the Victims Rights and Support Act 2013.
(3)  In the case of an amount ordered to be paid by the offender pursuant to a provisional order for restitution under Division 2 of Part 5 of the Victims Rights and Support Act 2013, the protected defendant may (while the provisional order is pending) withhold that amount from the damages payable to the offender.
(3A)  A protected defendant who withholds an amount under subsection (3) may require the NSW Trustee and Guardian to hold the amount on its behalf. However, the protected defendant must require the NSW Trustee and Guardian to hold the amount if the offender requests it.
(3B)  Interest is payable on an amount that is withheld under subsection (3). The amount of interest payable on the withheld amount is:
(a)  if the protected defendant has retained the withheld amount—the amount of interest determined in accordance with the provisions relating to interest payable under a judgment of the same amount of the Local Court in proceedings on a statement of claim under the Civil Procedure Act 2005, or
(b)  if the NSW Trustee and Guardian holds the withheld amount for the protected defendant—the amount of interest received by the NSW Trustee and Guardian in respect of the investment of the amount as provided by the NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009.
(3C)  If the provisional order for restitution on the basis of which an amount was withheld under subsection (3) is confirmed under the Victims Rights and Support Act 2013, any interest payable on the withheld amount under this section must be paid as follows:
(a)  if the NSW Trustee and Guardian holds the withheld amount for the protected defendant—the reasonable costs of the NSW Trustee and Guardian in connection with that holding are to be paid out of the interest,
(b)  if the amount ordered for restitution is not reduced on the confirmation—all of the interest (or remaining interest after payment of the NSW Trustee and Guardian’s costs) must be paid to the person (payee) to whom the order for restitution requires payment to be made or, if there is more than one payee, to each payee in the same proportion as corresponds to the payee’s proportion of the total amount of restitution,
(c)  if the amount ordered for restitution is reduced on the confirmation:
(i)  the offender must be paid the proportion of the interest (or remaining interest after payment of the NSW Trustee and Guardian’s costs) that corresponds to the proportion by which the withheld amount was reduced, and
(ii)  the rest of the interest must be paid to the payee or, if there is more than one payee, to each payee in the same proportion as corresponds to the payee’s proportion of the reduced amount.
(4)  The protected defendant or the NSW Trustee and Guardian (as the case may be) is to pay an amount deducted under this section to the person to whom the order for restitution requires payment be made.
(5)  Payment made by a protected defendant or the NSW Trustee and Guardian (as the case may be) pursuant to this section is, to the extent of the amount paid, taken to be a payment to the offender in satisfaction of the obligation to pay the damages concerned.
Division 6 Offender damages trust funds


#### 26K   Interpretation
(1)  In this Division:
award of damages means an award of damages by a court (including such an award pursuant to judgment entered in accordance with an agreement between the parties to a claim for damages).
offender means a person to whom an award of offender damages is made.
offender damages means personal injury damages awarded pursuant to an award to which this Part applies.
Note. For the purposes of this Division, this Part has an extended application. See Part 7 of Schedule 1.
victim claim means a claim for personal injury damages in respect of:
(a)  an injury to a person caused by conduct of an offender that, on the balance of probabilities, constitutes an offence, or
(b)  the death of a person caused by or resulting from an injury to the person caused by conduct of an offender that, on the balance of probabilities, constitutes an offence.
victim trust fund means offender damages awarded to an offender that are held on trust under this Division.
(2)  The definition of victim claim in this section:
(a)  operates whether or not a person whose conduct is alleged to constitute an offence has been, will be or is capable of being proceeded against or convicted of any offence concerned, and
(b)  extends to conduct of a person that would have constituted an offence if the person had not been suffering from a mental illness at the time of the conduct (whether or not the person was acquitted of an offence concerning that conduct by reason of mental illness or was found by a court not to be fit to be tried for an offence concerning that conduct by reason of such an illness).
26L   Offender damages to be held in trust as victim trust fund
(1)  The protected defendant liable to pay offender damages awarded to an offender is to pay those damages to the NSW Trustee and Guardian to be held in trust for the offender and paid out only as authorised by this Division.
(2)  Offender damages held in trust for an offender under this Division comprise a victim trust fund for victims of the offender. The protected defendant liable to pay those damages is responsible for the fund.
(3)  This section does not affect (and is subject to) any obligation imposed on the protected defendant by or under an enactment of the State or the Commonwealth to pay to some other person money owed or due to or held on account of the offender.
Note. Section 26T also provides an exception to this section for legal costs.
(4)  An amount deducted or withheld from offender damages under Division 5 (Victims support payments owed by offender) is not required to be held in trust under this section.
(5)  An amount held in a victim trust fund for victims of an offender is:
(a)  not available for the payment of a creditor of the offender, and
(b)  not liable to be attached or taken in execution at the instance of a creditor of the offender.
(6)  While offender damages are held in a victim trust fund, the liability of a protected defendant to pay those damages is suspended.


#### 26M   Victim trust fund available to satisfy eligible victim claims
(1)  A victim trust fund is available to satisfy victim claims against the offender concerned as provided by this Division but only if the claim is eligible to be satisfied from the victim trust fund as provided by this section.
(2)  A victim claim is eligible to be satisfied from a victim trust fund only if within the eligibility period for the victim trust fund:
(a)  the person commences proceedings on the claim in a court (or proceedings by the person on the claim are pending in a court at the beginning of the eligibility period), and
(b)  the person gives the protected defendant responsible for the victim trust fund notice in writing of those proceedings together with such details of those proceedings as the protected defendant may request, and
(c)  the person certifies to the court before which those proceedings are taken that the person is making the claim as a claim that is eligible to be satisfied from the victim trust fund.
(3)  The eligibility period for a victim trust fund comprising offender damages awarded to an offender is the period of 12 months following the date (the award date for those damages) on which the claim for those damages is finally determined by a court award of those damages.
(4)  A claim is not finally determined if:
(a)  any period for bringing an appeal as of right in respect of the claim has not expired (ignoring any period that may be available by way of extension of time to appeal), or
(b)  any appeal in respect of the claim is pending (whether or not it is an appeal brought as of right).
(5)  The protected defendant responsible for a victim trust fund must give the registrar of each court in which a victim claim may be brought notice of each victim claim of which the protected defendant is given notice under this section.


#### 26N   Notice to persons entitled to make victim claim
(1)  The protected defendant responsible for a victim trust fund must send to each person who appears (from any information reasonably available to the protected defendant) to have a victim claim against the offender a notice in writing:
(a)  naming the offender and stating that there is a victim trust fund for victims of the offender, and
(b)  specifying the eligibility period for that victim trust fund, and
(c)  stating that a victim claim made within the eligibility period for the victim trust fund may be eligible to be satisfied from the victim trust fund.
(1A)  The notice must be sent as far as practicable within 28 days after the award date for the damages concerned (but this subsection does not prevent the notice from being sent more than 28 days after the award).
(2)  The notice is to be sent to a person at the address of the person last known to the protected defendant or as disclosed by any information reasonably available to the protected defendant.
(3)  The protected defendant may also publish such a notice in the Gazette.
(4)  To remove doubt, victim claim in this section includes a victim claim that can be made as a result of section 26P (Commencement of victim claims proceedings despite expiry of limitation period).
(5)  The Commissioner of Police is authorised to provide a protected defendant with any information in the Commissioner’s possession that the protected defendant may reasonably require for:
(a)  identifying and contacting persons who may have a victim claim against the offender, or
(b)  determining whether a person appears to have a victim claim against the offender.


#### 26O   Provision of information to persons entitled to claim
(1)  A protected defendant must, in response to a request made during or within 1 month after the eligibility period for a victim trust fund by or on behalf of a person who appears to the protected defendant to be entitled to make a victim claim against the offender, provide such information as the protected defendant is reasonably able to provide concerning:
(a)  the award of damages to the offender and the amount of the victim trust fund, and
(b)  any other victim claim against the offender that may be eligible to be satisfied from the victim trust fund and of which the protected defendant has been given notice under this Division.
(2)  The provision of information by a protected defendant under this section:
(a)  is authorised despite any agreement to which the protected defendant is a party that would otherwise prohibit or restrict the disclosure of information concerning an award of offender damages, and
(b)  does not constitute a contravention of any such agreement.
(3)  A person to whom information is provided under this section must not disclose that information to any other person except for the purposes of or in connection with the taking and determination of proceedings on a victim claim against the offender concerned.
Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units.
(4)  Proceedings for an offence under this section may be dealt with summarily before the Local Court.


#### 26P   Commencement of victim claims proceedings despite expiry of limitation period
(1)  If there is a victim trust fund for victims of an offender, an action on a cause of action to recover damages pursuant to a victim claim against the offender is (despite any provision of the Limitation Act 1969) maintainable by proceedings on the cause of action commenced during the eligibility period for the victim trust fund.
(2)  The right and title to damages of a person formerly having such a cause of action that has been extinguished by the expiration of a limitation period fixed by or under the Limitation Act 1969 is reinstated for the purposes of proceedings on the cause of action that are commenced during the eligibility period for the victim trust fund.
(3)  However, an award of damages in proceedings commenced under this section (that could not otherwise be commenced):
(a)  has effect only for the purpose of enabling an order to be made under this Division for the payment of the whole or a specified part of those damages out of money held in the victim trust fund concerned, and
(b)  cannot otherwise be enforced against the offender concerned or any property of the offender.


#### 26Q   Orders for payment of damages out of money held in trust for victims of offender
(1)  A court that awards damages to a person on a victim claim against an offender may, if satisfied that the claim is eligible to be satisfied from a victim trust fund for victims of the offender, order that the whole or a specified part of those damages is to be paid out of money held in the victim trust fund.
(2)  Before the court orders the payment of damages out of money held in the victim trust fund, the court must consider:
(a)  whether there are or are likely to be other victim claims eligible to be satisfied from the victim trust fund that may be ordered to be wholly or partly satisfied by payment from the victim trust fund, and
(b)  the amount of the damages likely to be awarded in respect of those claims.
(3)  In determining the amount of any damages to be ordered to be paid out of a victim trust fund, a court must ensure that the amount ordered to be paid:
(a)  is fair and reasonable having regard to the existence of other claims that are eligible to be satisfied from the fund and that may be ordered to be wholly or partly satisfied by payment from the fund, and the amounts likely to be awarded in respect of those claims, and
(b)  does not, as a proportion of the amount of the victim trust fund, exceed the proportion that the damages awarded represents as a proportion of the total damages likely to be awarded in respect of all claims eligible to be satisfied from the fund.
(4)  A court may defer making an order for the payment of damages out of a victim trust fund until the court is satisfied that it is able to make a reasonable assessment of the extent of claims eligible to be satisfied from the fund.
(5)  The payment of an amount out of a victim trust fund in accordance with an order of a court under this section is taken to be a payment made at the direction of the offender and operates as a discharge, to the extent of the payment, of:
(a)  the liability of the protected defendant to pay the amount to the offender concerned as offender damages, and
(b)  the obligation of the NSW Trustee and Guardian to hold the amount in trust for the offender concerned.
(6)  An order of a court under this section is not subject to appeal except on a question of law.


#### 26QA   Court may deal with victim claim on the papers
A court is to determine a victim claim made to it without conducting a hearing unless it is satisfied that the interests of justice require that a hearing be held in the presence of the parties.


#### 26R   Payment to offender of trust fund surplus
(1)  When the protected defendant responsible for a victim trust fund is satisfied that all claims eligible to be satisfied from the fund have been finally determined, the protected defendant is to make a determination of the surplus (if any) in the fund.
(1A)  A claim is not finally determined if:
(a)  any period for bringing an appeal as of right in respect of the claim has not expired (ignoring any period that may be available by way of extension of time to appeal), or
(b)  any appeal in respect of the claim is pending (whether or not it is an appeal brought as of right).
(2)  A court that awards damages to a person on a victim claim against an offender may give directions to the protected defendant concerned in respect of the determination by the protected defendant of the surplus (if any) in the victim trust fund concerned.
(3)  If a protected defendant responsible for a victim trust fund determines and certifies to the NSW Trustee and Guardian that there is a surplus in the fund, the NSW Trustee and Guardian must pay the certified surplus to or at the direction of the offender concerned.
(4)  The surplus in a victim trust fund is the amount that will remain in the fund after payment out of the fund of the following amounts:
(a)  the amount of all claims eligible to be satisfied from the fund that are ordered by a court under this Division to be paid out of the fund,
(b)  all amounts payable to the NSW Trustee and Guardian out of the fund.
26S   Functions of the NSW Trustee and Guardian
(1)    (Repealed)
(2)  Interest received by the NSW Trustee and Guardian in respect of the investment of an amount held by the NSW Trustee and Guardian under this Division is payable to and forms part of the victim trust fund of which the amount forms part.
(3), (4)    (Repealed)
(5)  The fees and expenses payable to the NSW Trustee and Guardian in connection with the exercise of functions by the NSW Trustee and Guardian under this Division are payable out of the victim trust fund in connection with which those functions are exercised.
(6)  The certificate of the NSW Trustee and Guardian as to the fees and expenses payable to the NSW Trustee and Guardian in connection with the exercise of functions by the NSW Trustee and Guardian under this Division is sufficient authority for the payment of the relevant amounts out of the victim trust fund concerned.


#### 26T   Exception for legal costs
(1)  This Division does not require any amount to be held in trust that is payable by the protected defendant as legal costs under an order for costs made against the protected defendant or (in the case of an award of damages that is inclusive of costs) that is reasonably attributable to the offender’s legal costs.
(2)  The amount reasonably attributable to the offender’s legal costs in the case of an award of damages that is inclusive of costs is the amount determined by the protected defendant on the basis of a bill for those costs provided to the protected defendant by the legal practitioner concerned.
(3)  If the amount determined by the protected defendant as the amount reasonably attributable to the offender’s legal costs is disputed, the protected defendant is to apply for the assessment of those costs under the legal profession legislation (as defined in section 3A of the Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014) (as if the protected defendant were liable to pay those costs as a result of an order for the payment of an unspecified amount of costs made by a court).
(4)  The costs of a costs assessment for the purposes of this section are payable:
(a)  by the offender (by deduction from the offender damages concerned), unless paragraph (b) applies, or
(b)  by the protected defendant if the amount of the costs as determined by the costs assessor is at least 10% more than the amount determined by the protected defendant.


#### 26U   Maximum legal costs of eligible claims
(1)  The maximum costs for legal services provided to the plaintiff in connection with a victim claim that is eligible to be satisfied from a victim trust fund are fixed as follows:
(a)  if the amount recovered on the claim does not exceed $100,000—maximum costs are fixed at 20% of the amount recovered or $10,000, whichever is greater,
(b)  if the amount recovered on the claim exceeds $100,000 but does not exceed $250,000—maximum costs are fixed at 18% of the amount recovered or $20,000, whichever is greater,
(c)  if the amount recovered on the claim exceeds $250,000 but does not exceed $500,000—maximum costs are fixed at 16% of the amount recovered or $45,000, whichever is greater,
(d)  if the amount recovered on the claim exceeds $500,000—maximum costs are fixed at 15% of the amount recovered or $80,000, whichever is greater.
(2)  The regulations may prescribe an amount or percentage to replace any amount or percentage in subsection (1). When such a replacement amount or percentage is prescribed, it applies for the purposes of subsection (1) in place of the amount or percentage that it replaces.
(3)  Schedule 1 (Maximum costs in personal injury damages matters) to the Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014 applies in respect of the maximum costs for legal services provided to a plaintiff in connection with a victim claim that is eligible to be satisfied from a victim trust fund as if subsections (1) and (2) of this section were substituted for subclauses (1) and (2) of clause 2 of that Schedule.
(4)    (Repealed)
(5)  The amount recovered on a claim is the full amount of the damages awarded (not just the amount ordered to be paid from a victim trust fund).


#### 26V   Protection from liability
(1)  An act or omission by a person as a public official does not subject the person personally to any action, liability, claim or demand if the act or omission was done or omitted to be done in good faith in the administration or execution of this Division.
(2)  In this section:
public official means:
(a)  a member of staff of or agent of a protected defendant, or
(b)  the NSW Trustee and Guardian, or a member of staff or agent of the NSW Trustee and Guardian, when the NSW Trustee and Guardian is acting under this Division.


#### 26W   Division overrides Part 7 Division 2
Division 2 (Supervision of damages arising out of criminal conduct by persons suffering from mental illness) of Part 7 does not apply to damages required to be held in trust under this Division.
Division 7 Miscellaneous


#### 26X   Limitation on exemplary, punitive and aggravated damages against protected defendant in cases of vicarious liability
(1)  In an action against a protected defendant for the award of personal injury damages where the act or omission that caused the injury or death was a tort (whether or not negligence) of a person for whose tort the protected defendant is vicariously liable, a court cannot award exemplary or punitive damages or damages in the nature of aggravated damages.
(2)  Subsection (1) does not limit the application of section 21 to actions for the award of personal injury damages to which this Part applies.
Note. Section 21 provides that a court cannot award exemplary or punitive damages or damages in the nature of aggravated damages in an action for the award of personal injury damages where the act or omission that caused the injury or death was negligence.

(a)  a claim for economic loss or damage to property in an action for damages (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising from a failure to take reasonable care, but not including any claim arising out of personal injury,
(b)  a claim for economic loss or damage to property in an action for damages under the Fair Trading Act 1987 for a contravention of section 42 of that Act (as in force before its repeal by the Fair Trading Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act 2010) or under the Australian Consumer Law (NSW) for a contravention of section 18 of that Law.
(1A)  For the purposes of this Part, there is a single apportionable claim in proceedings in respect of the same loss or damage even if the claim for the loss or damage is based on more than one cause of action (whether or not of the same or a different kind).
(2)  In this Part, a concurrent wrongdoer, in relation to a claim, is a person who is one of two or more persons whose acts or omissions (or act or omission) caused, independently of each other or jointly, the damage or loss that is the subject of the claim.
(3)  For the purposes of this Part, apportionable claims are limited to those claims specified in subsection (1).

(5)    (Repealed)


#### 34A   Certain concurrent wrongdoers not to have benefit of apportionment
(1)  Nothing in this Part operates to limit the liability of a concurrent wrongdoer (an excluded concurrent wrongdoer) in proceedings involving an apportionable claim if:
(a)  the concurrent wrongdoer intended to cause the economic loss or damage to property that is the subject of the claim, or
(b)  the concurrent wrongdoer fraudulently caused the economic loss or damage to property that is the subject of the claim, or
(c)  the civil liability of the concurrent wrongdoer was otherwise of a kind excluded from the operation of this Part by section 3B.
(2)  The liability of an excluded concurrent wrongdoer is to be determined in accordance with the legal rules, if any, that (apart from this Part) are relevant.
(3)  The liability of any other concurrent wrongdoer who is not an excluded concurrent wrongdoer is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Part.


#### 35   Proportionate liability for apportionable claims
(1)  In any proceedings involving an apportionable claim:
(a)  the liability of a defendant who is a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to that claim is limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the damage or loss claimed that the court considers just having regard to the extent of the defendant’s responsibility for the damage or loss, and
(b)  the court may give judgment against the defendant for not more than that amount.
(2)  If the proceedings involve both an apportionable claim and a claim that is not an apportionable claim:
(a)  liability for the apportionable claim is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Part, and
(b)  liability for the other claim is to be determined in accordance with the legal rules, if any, that (apart from this Part) are relevant.
(3)  In apportioning responsibility between defendants in the proceedings:
(a)  the court is to exclude that proportion of the damage or loss in relation to which the plaintiff is contributorily negligent under any relevant law, and
(b)  the court may have regard to the comparative responsibility of any concurrent wrongdoer who is not a party to the proceedings.
(4)  This section applies in proceedings involving an apportionable claim whether or not all concurrent wrongdoers are parties to the proceedings.
(5)  A reference in this Part to a defendant in proceedings includes any person joined as a defendant or other party in the proceedings (except as a plaintiff) whether joined under this Part, under rules of court or otherwise.


#### 35A   Duty of defendant to inform plaintiff about concurrent wrongdoers
(1)  If:
(a)  a defendant in proceedings involving an apportionable claim has reasonable grounds to believe that a particular person (the other person) may be a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim, and
(b)  the defendant fails to give the plaintiff, as soon as practicable, written notice of the information that the defendant has about:
(i)  the identity of the other person, and
(ii)  the circumstances that may make the other person a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim, and
(c)  the plaintiff unnecessarily incurs costs in the proceedings because the plaintiff was not aware that the other person may be a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim,
the court hearing the proceedings may order that the defendant pay all or any of those costs of the plaintiff.
(2)  The court may order that the costs to be paid by the defendant be assessed on an indemnity basis or otherwise.


#### 36   Contribution not recoverable from defendant
A defendant against whom judgment is given under this Part as a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to an apportionable claim:
(a)  cannot be required to contribute to any damages or contribution recovered from another concurrent wrongdoer in respect of the apportionable claim (whether or not the damages or contribution are recovered in the same proceedings in which judgment is given against the defendant), and
(b)  cannot be required to indemnify any such wrongdoer.


#### 37   Subsequent actions
(1)  In relation to an apportionable claim, nothing in this Part or any other law prevents a plaintiff who has previously recovered judgment against a concurrent wrongdoer for an apportionable part of any damage or loss from bringing another action against any other concurrent wrongdoer for that damage or loss.
(2)  However, in any proceedings in respect of any such action the plaintiff cannot recover an amount of damages that, having regard to any damages previously recovered by the plaintiff in respect of the damage or loss, would result in the plaintiff receiving compensation for damage or loss that is greater than the damage or loss actually sustained by the plaintiff.


#### 38   Joining non-party concurrent wrongdoer in the action
(1)  The court may give leave for any one or more persons to be joined as defendants in proceedings involving an apportionable claim.
(2)  The court is not to give leave for the joinder of any person who was a party to any previously concluded proceedings in respect of the apportionable claim.


#### 39   Application of Part
Nothing in this Part:
(a)  prevents a person from being held vicariously liable for a proportion of any apportionable claim for which another person is liable, or
(b)  prevents a partner from being held severally liable with another partner for that proportion of an apportionable claim for which the other partner is liable, or
(c)  affects the operation of any other Act to the extent that it imposes several liability on any person in respect of what would otherwise be an apportionable claim.


Part 5 Liability of public and other authorities
===============================================================================


#### 40   Application of Part
(1)  This Part applies to civil liability in tort.
(2)  This Part extends to any such liability even if the damages are sought in an action for breach of contract or any other action.
(3)  This Part does not apply to civil liability that is excluded from the operation of this Part by section 3B.


#### 41   Definitions
In this Part:
exercise a function includes perform a duty.
function includes a power, authority or duty.
public or other authority means:
(a)  the Crown (within the meaning of the Crown Proceedings Act 1988), or
(b)  a Government department, or
(c)  a public health organisation within the meaning of the Health Services Act 1997, or
(d)  a local council, or
(e)  any public or local authority constituted by or under an Act, or
(e1)  any person having public official functions or acting in a public official capacity (whether or not employed as a public official), but only in relation to the exercise of the person’s public official functions, or

(g)  any person or body in respect of the exercise of public or other functions of a class prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this Part.


#### 42   Principles concerning resources, responsibilities etc of public or other authorities
The following principles apply in determining whether a public or other authority has a duty of care or has breached a duty of care in proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies:
(a)  the functions required to be exercised by the authority are limited by the financial and other resources that are reasonably available to the authority for the purpose of exercising those functions,
(b)  the general allocation of those resources by the authority is not open to challenge,
(c)  the functions required to be exercised by the authority are to be determined by reference to the broad range of its activities (and not merely by reference to the matter to which the proceedings relate),
(d)  the authority may rely on evidence of its compliance with the general procedures and applicable standards for the exercise of its functions as evidence of the proper exercise of its functions in the matter to which the proceedings relate.


#### 43   Proceedings against public or other authorities based on breach of statutory duty
(1)  This section applies to proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies to the extent that the liability is based on a breach of a statutory duty by a public or other authority in connection with the exercise of or a failure to exercise a function of the authority.
(2)  For the purposes of any such proceedings, an act or omission of the authority does not constitute a breach of statutory duty unless the act or omission was in the circumstances so unreasonable that no authority having the functions of the authority in question could properly consider the act or omission to be a reasonable exercise of its functions.
(3)  In the case of a function of a public or other authority to prohibit or regulate an activity, this section applies in addition to section 44.


#### 43A   Proceedings against public or other authorities for the exercise of special statutory powers
(1)  This section applies to proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies to the extent that the liability is based on a public or other authority’s exercise of, or failure to exercise, a special statutory power conferred on the authority.
(2)  A special statutory power is a power:
(a)  that is conferred by or under a statute, and
(b)  that is of a kind that persons generally are not authorised to exercise without specific statutory authority.
(3)  For the purposes of any such proceedings, any act or omission involving an exercise of, or failure to exercise, a special statutory power does not give rise to civil liability unless the act or omission was in the circumstances so unreasonable that no authority having the special statutory power in question could properly consider the act or omission to be a reasonable exercise of, or failure to exercise, its power.
(4)  In the case of a special statutory power of a public or other authority to prohibit or regulate an activity, this section applies in addition to section 44.


#### 44   When public or other authority not liable for failure to exercise regulatory functions
(1)  A public or other authority is not liable in proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies to the extent that the liability is based on the failure of the authority to exercise or to consider exercising any function of the authority to prohibit or regulate an activity if the authority could not have been required to exercise the function in proceedings instituted by the plaintiff.
(2)  Without limiting what constitutes a function to regulate an activity for the purposes of this section, a function to issue a licence, permit or other authority in respect of an activity, or to register or otherwise authorise a person in connection with an activity, constitutes a function to regulate the activity.


#### 45   Special non-feasance protection for roads authorities
(1)  A roads authority is not liable in proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies for harm arising from a failure of the authority to carry out road work, or to consider carrying out road work, unless at the time of the alleged failure the authority had actual knowledge of the particular risk the materialisation of which resulted in the harm.
(2)  This section does not operate:
(a)  to create a duty of care in respect of a risk merely because a roads authority has actual knowledge of the risk, or
(b)  to affect any standard of care that would otherwise be applicable in respect of a risk.
(3)  In this section:
carry out road work means carry out any activity in connection with the construction, erection, installation, maintenance, inspection, repair, removal or replacement of a road work within the meaning of the Roads Act 1993.
roads authority has the same meaning as in the Roads Act 1993.


#### 46   Exercise of function or decision to exercise does not create duty
In proceedings to which this Part applies, the fact that a public or other authority exercises or decides to exercise a function does not of itself indicate that the authority is under a duty to exercise the function or that the function should be exercised in particular circumstances or in a particular way.


Part 6 Intoxication
===============================================================================


#### 47   Part applies to civil liability for death, injury or property damage
(1)  This Part applies to civil liability of any kind for personal injury damages (as defined in Part 2) or damage to property.
(2)  This Part does not apply to civil liability that is excluded from the operation of this Part by section 3B.


#### 48   Definition of “intoxication”
A reference in this Part to a person being intoxicated is a reference to a person being under the influence of alcohol or a drug (whether or not taken for a medicinal purpose and whether or not lawfully taken).


#### 49   Effect of intoxication on duty and standard of care
(1)  The following principles apply in connection with the effect that a person’s intoxication has on the duty and standard of care that the person is owed:
(a)  in determining whether a duty of care arises, it is not relevant to consider the possibility or likelihood that a person may be intoxicated or that a person who is intoxicated may be exposed to increased risk because the person’s capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill is impaired as a result of being intoxicated,
(b)  a person is not owed a duty of care merely because the person is intoxicated,
(c)  the fact that a person is or may be intoxicated does not of itself increase or otherwise affect the standard of care owed to the person.
(2)  This section applies in place of a provision of section 74 of the Motor Accidents Act 1988 or section 138 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 to the extent of any inconsistency between this section and the provision.


#### 50   No recovery where person intoxicated
(1)  This section applies when it is established that the person whose death, injury or damage is the subject of proceedings for the recovery of damages was at the time of the act or omission that caused the death, injury or damage intoxicated to the extent that the person’s capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill was impaired.
(2)  A court is not to award damages in respect of liability to which this Part applies unless satisfied that the death, injury or damage to property (or some other injury or damage to property) is likely to have occurred even if the person had not been intoxicated.
(3)  If the court is satisfied that the death, injury or damage to property (or some other injury or damage to property) is likely to have occurred even if the person had not been intoxicated, it is to be presumed that the person was contributorily negligent unless the court is satisfied that the person’s intoxication did not contribute in any way to the cause of the death, injury or damage.
(4)  When there is a presumption of contributory negligence, the court must assess damages on the basis that the damages to which the person would be entitled in the absence of contributory negligence are to be reduced on account of contributory negligence by 25% or a greater percentage determined by the court to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case.
(5)  This section does not apply in a case where the court is satisfied that the intoxication was not self-induced.

(a)  the liability arises out of the death of, or injury or damage to, a person, and
