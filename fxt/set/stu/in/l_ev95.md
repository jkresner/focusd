An Act about the law of evidence, and for related purposes.


Chapter 1 Preliminary
===============================================================================

Introductory note:
 
#### Outline of this Act
This Act sets out the State rules of evidence. Generally speaking, the Act applies to proceedings in State courts and before other persons or bodies required to apply the laws of evidence (see section 4).
Chapter 2 is about how evidence is adduced in proceedings.
Chapter 3 is about admissibility of evidence in proceedings.
Chapter 4 is about proof of matters in proceedings.
Chapter 5 deals with miscellaneous matters.
The Dictionary at the end of this Act defines terms and expressions used in this Act.
Related legislation
This Act is in most respects uniform with the Evidence Act 1995 of the Commonwealth. The 2 Acts are drafted in identical terms except so far as differences are identified by appropriate annotations to the texts, and except so far as minor drafting variations are required because one Act is a New South Wales Act and one Act is a Commonwealth Act.
If one Act contains a provision that is not included in the other Act, the numbering of the other Act has a gap in the numbering in order to maintain consistent numbering for the other provisions.
In relation to the taking of evidence outside New South Wales for the purposes of proceedings in the State and in relation to the taking of evidence in the State for the purposes of proceedings outside New South Wales see the Evidence on Commission Act 1995.


Part 1.1 Formal matters
===============================================================================


#### 1   Name of Act
This Act is the Evidence Act 1995.


#### 2   Commencement
(1)  This Part and the Dictionary at the end of this Act commence on the date of assent.
(2)  The remaining provisions of this Act commence on a day or days to be appointed by proclamation.


#### 3   Definitions
(1)  Expressions used in this Act (or in a particular provision of this Act) that are defined in the Dictionary at the end of this Act have the meanings given to them in the Dictionary.
(2)  Notes included in this Act are explanatory notes and do not form part of this Act.
(3)  Without limiting the effect of, and subject to, section 34 of the Interpretation Act 1987, material that may be used in the interpretation of a provision of this Act includes any relevant report of a Law Reform Commission laid before either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth before the provision was enacted.

    > *Notes* 1  Some expressions used in this Act are defined in the Interpretation Act 1987, and have the meanings given to them in that Act.
    2  The Commonwealth Act includes a different subsection (3). This is to the same effect as section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1987. Subsection 
    3  of the NSW Act is covered by section 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 of the Commonwealth.


Part 1.2 Application of this Act
===============================================================================


#### 4   Courts and proceedings to which Act applies
(1)  This Act applies to all proceedings in a NSW court, including proceedings that:
(a)  relate to bail, subject to Division 4 of Part 3 of the Bail Act 2013, or
(b)  are interlocutory proceedings or proceedings of a similar kind, or
(c)  are heard in chambers, or
(d)  subject to subsection (2), relate to sentencing.
(2)  If such a proceeding relates to sentencing:
(a)  this Act applies only if the court directs that the law of evidence applies in the proceeding, and
(b)  if the court specifies in the direction that the law of evidence applies only in relation to specified matters—the direction has effect accordingly.
(3)  The court must make a direction if:
(a)  a party to the proceeding applies for such a direction in relation to the proof of a fact, and
(b)  in the court’s opinion, the proceeding involves proof of that fact, and that fact is or will be significant in determining a sentence to be imposed in the proceeding.
(4)  The court must make a direction if the court considers it appropriate to make such a direction in the interests of justice.

    > *Notes* 1   Section 4 of the Commonwealth Act differs from this section. It applies that Act to proceedings in a federal court or an ACT court. Some provisions of the Commonwealth Act extend beyond proceedings in federal courts and ACT courts (see sections 5, 185, 186 and 187 of the Commonwealth Act).
    2   NSW court is defined in the Dictionary. The definition includes persons or bodies required to apply the laws of evidence.
    3   The Commonwealth Act includes 2 additional subsections that exclude the application of that Act to appeals from a court of a State (including appeals from a court of a State exercising federal jurisdiction) and certain other courts.
    4   See section 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 of the Commonwealth for the application of this Act to proceedings in a State court exercising federal jurisdiction.


#### 5   Extended application of certain provisions
> *Note*  The Commonwealth Act includes a provision that extends the application of specified provisions of the Commonwealth Act to proceedings in all Australian courts.


#### 6   Territories
> *Note* The Commonwealth Act includes a provision extending that Act to each external Territory.


#### 7   Act binds Crown
This Act binds the Crown in right of New South Wales and also, so far as the legislative power of Parliament permits, in all its other capacities.


#### 8   Operation of other Acts
This Act does not affect the operation of the provisions of any other Act.
> *Note* The Commonwealth Act includes additional subsections relating to the operation of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 of the Commonwealth and certain laws in force in the ACT. It also provides for the regulations to have continued effect (until amended) after the commencement of the Commonwealth section.


#### 9   Application of common law and equity
(1)  This Act does not affect the operation of a principle or rule of common law or equity in relation to evidence in a proceeding to which this Act applies, except so far as this Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary intendment.
(2)  Without limiting subsection (1), this Act does not affect the operation of such a principle or rule so far as it relates to any of the following:
(a)  admission or use of evidence of reasons for a decision of a member of a jury, or of the deliberations of a member of a jury in relation to such a decision, in a proceeding by way of appeal from a judgment, decree, order or sentence of a court,
(b)  the operation of a legal or evidential presumption that is not inconsistent with this Act,
(c)  a court’s power to dispense with the operation of a rule of evidence or procedure in an interlocutory proceeding.

    Note.
     This section differs from section 9 of the Commonwealth Act. That section preserves the written and unwritten laws of States and Territories in relation to various matters.


#### 10   Parliamentary privilege preserved
(1)  This Act does not affect the law relating to the privileges of any Australian Parliament or any House of any Australian Parliament.
(2)  In particular, section 15 (2) does not affect, and is in addition to, the law relating to such privileges.


#### 11   General powers of a court
(1)  The power of a court to control the conduct of a proceeding is not affected by this Act, except so far as this Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary intendment.
(2)  In particular, the powers of a court with respect to abuse of process in a proceeding are not affected.

(2)  A person who, because of subsection (1), is not competent to give evidence about a fact may be competent to give evidence about other facts.

(c)  that he or she may be asked questions that suggest certain statements are true or untrue and that he or she should agree with the statements that he or she believes are true and should feel no pressure to agree with statements that he or she believes are untrue.
(6)  It is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that a person is not incompetent because of this section.
(7)  Evidence that has been given by a witness does not become inadmissible merely because, before the witness finishes giving evidence, he or she dies or ceases to be competent to give evidence.
(8)  For the purpose of determining a question arising under this section, the court may inform itself as it thinks fit, including by obtaining information from a person who has relevant specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience.


#### 14   Compellability: reduced capacity
A person is not compellable to give evidence on a particular matter if the court is satisfied that:
(a)  substantial cost or delay would be incurred in ensuring that the person would have the capacity to understand a question about the matter or to give an answer that can be understood to a question about the matter, and
(b)  adequate evidence on that matter has been given, or will be able to be given, from one or more other persons or sources.

#### 17   Competence and compellability: defendants in criminal proceedings
(1)  This section applies only in a criminal proceeding.
(2)  A defendant is not competent to give evidence as a witness for the prosecution.
(3)  An associated defendant is not compellable to give evidence for or against a defendant in a criminal proceeding, unless the associated defendant is being tried separately from the defendant.
(4)  If a witness is an associated defendant who is being tried jointly with the defendant in the proceeding, the court is to satisfy itself (if there is a jury, in the jury’s absence) that the witness is aware of the effect of subsection (3).

    > *Note* Associated defendant is defined in the Dictionary.


#### 18   Compellability of spouses and others in criminal proceedings generally
(1)  This section applies only in a criminal proceeding.
(2)  A person who, when required to give evidence, is the spouse, de facto partner, parent or child of a defendant may object to being required:
(a)  to give evidence, or
(b)  to give evidence of a communication between the person and the defendant,
     as a witness for the prosecution.
(3)  The objection is to be made before the person gives the evidence or as soon as practicable after the person becomes aware of the right so to object, whichever is the later.
(4)  If it appears to the court that a person may have a right to make an objection under this section, the court is to satisfy itself that the person is aware of the effect of this section as it may apply to the person.
(5)  If there is a jury, the court is to hear and determine any objection under this section in the absence of the jury.
(6)  A person who makes an objection under this section to giving evidence or giving evidence of a communication must not be required to give the evidence if the court finds that:
(a)  there is a likelihood that harm would or might be caused (whether directly or indirectly) to the person, or to the relationship between the person and the defendant, if the person gives the evidence, and
(b)  the nature and extent of that harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence given.
(7)  Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court for the purposes of subsection (6), it must take into account the following:
(a)  the nature and gravity of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted,
(b)  the substance and importance of any evidence that the person might give and the weight that is likely to be attached to it,
(c)  whether any other evidence concerning the matters to which the evidence of the person would relate is reasonably available to the prosecutor,
(d)  the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the person,
(e)  whether, in giving the evidence, the person would have to disclose matter that was received by the person in confidence from the defendant.

#### 20   Comment on failure to give evidence
(1)  This section applies only in a criminal proceeding for an indictable offence.
(2)  The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned.
(3)  The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure to give evidence by a person who, at the time of the failure, was:
(a)  the defendant’s spouse or de facto partner, or
(b)  a parent or child of the defendant.
(4)  However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, a comment of a kind referred to in subsection (3) must not suggest that the spouse, de facto partner, parent or child failed to give evidence because:
(a)  the defendant was guilty of the offence concerned, or
(b)  the spouse, de facto partner, parent or child believed that the defendant was guilty of the offence concerned.
(5)  If:
(a)  2 or more persons are being tried together for an indictable offence, and

(5)  Such an affirmation has the same effect for all purposes as an oath.


#### 22   Interpreters to act on oath or affirmation
(1)  A person must either take an oath, or make an affirmation, before acting as an interpreter in a proceeding.
(1A)  An oath taken, or an affirmation made, by a person before acting as an interpreter on a day is taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to be an oath taken or affirmation made by that person for the purposes of any subsequent proceedings in that court on that day in which the person acts as an interpreter.
(2)  The person is to take the oath, or make the affirmation, in accordance with the appropriate form in Schedule 1 or in a similar form.

(b)  did not understand the nature and consequences of the oath.


#### 24A   Alternative oath
(1)  A person may take an oath even if the person’s religious or spiritual beliefs do not include a belief in the existence of a god.
(2)  Despite anything to the contrary in this Act, the form of oath taken by a person:

(b)  may instead refer to the basis of the person’s beliefs in accordance with a form prescribed by the regulations.

    Note.

#### 25   Rights to make unsworn statements unaffected

    * * * * *
    Note.
     The Commonwealth Act includes a provision preserving any right of a defendant under the law of a State or Territory to make an unsworn statement. The right to make an unsworn statement remains in Norfolk Island.


Division 3 General rules about giving evidence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### 26   Court’s control over questioning of witnesses
The court may make such orders as it considers just in relation to:
(a)  the way in which witnesses are to be questioned, and
(b)  the production and use of documents and things in connection with the questioning of witnesses, and
(c)  the order in which parties may question a witness, and
(d)  the presence and behaviour of any person in connection with the questioning of witnesses.


#### 27   Parties may question witnesses
A party may question any witness, except as provided by this Act.


#### 28   Order of examination in chief, cross-examination and re-examination
Unless the court otherwise directs:
(a)  cross-examination of a witness is not to take place before the examination in chief of the witness, and

#### 29   Manner and form of questioning witnesses and their responses
(1)  A party may question a witness in any way the party thinks fit, except as provided by this Chapter or as directed by the court.
(2)  A court may, on its own motion or on the application of the party that called the witness, direct that the witness give evidence wholly or partly in narrative form.
(3)  Such a direction may include directions about the way in which evidence is to be given in that form.
(4)  Evidence may be given in the form of charts, summaries or other explanatory material if it appears to the court that the material would be likely to aid its comprehension of other evidence that has been given or is to be given.


#### 30   Interpreters
A witness may give evidence about a fact through an interpreter unless the witness can understand and speak the English language sufficiently to enable the witness to understand, and to make an adequate reply to, questions that may be put about the fact.


#### 31   Deaf and mute witnesses
(1)  A witness who cannot hear adequately may be questioned in any appropriate way.
(2)  A witness who cannot speak adequately may give evidence by any appropriate means.

#### 32   Attempts to revive memory in court
(1)  A witness must not, in the course of giving evidence, use a document to try to revive his or her memory about a fact or opinion unless the court gives leave.
(2)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give leave, it is to take into account:
(a)  whether the witness will be able to recall the fact or opinion adequately without using the document, and
(b)  whether so much of the document as the witness proposes to use is, or is a copy of, a document that:
  (i)  was written or made by the witness when the events recorded in it were fresh in his or her memory, or
  (ii)  was, at such a time, found by the witness to be accurate.
(3)  If a witness has, while giving evidence, used a document to try to revive his or her memory about a fact or opinion, the witness may, with the leave of the court, read aloud, as part of his or her evidence, so much of the document as relates to that fact or opinion.
(4)  The court is, on the request of a party, to give such directions as the court thinks fit to ensure that so much of the document as relates to the proceeding is produced to that party.


#### 33   Evidence given by police officers
(1)  Despite section 32, in any criminal proceeding, a police officer may give evidence in chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer.
(2)  Evidence may not be so given unless:
(a)  the statement was made by the police officer at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers, and

(c)  a copy of the statement had been given to the person charged or to his or her Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel a reasonable time before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution.
(3)  A reference in this section to a police officer includes a reference to a person who, at the time the statement concerned was made, was a police officer.


#### 34   Attempts to revive memory out of court
(1)  The court may, on the request of a party, give such directions as are appropriate to ensure that specified documents and things used by a witness otherwise than while giving evidence to try to revive his or her memory are produced to the party for the purposes of the proceeding.
(2)  The court may refuse to admit the evidence given by the witness so far as it concerns a fact as to which the witness so tried to revive his or her memory if, without reasonable excuse, the directions have not been complied with.


#### 35   Effect of calling for production of documents
(1)  A party is not to be required to tender a document only because the party, whether under this Act or otherwise:
(a)  called for the document to be produced to the party, or
(b)  inspected it when it was so produced.
(2)  The party who produces a document so called for is not entitled to tender it only because the party to whom it was produced, or who inspected it, fails to tender it.

(1)  The court may order a person who:
(a)  is present at the hearing of a proceeding, and

    to give evidence and to produce documents or things even if a subpoena or other process requiring the person to attend for that purpose has not been duly served on the person.
(2)  A person so ordered to give evidence or to produce documents or things is subject to the same penalties and liabilities as if the person had been duly served with such a subpoena or other process.
(3)  A party who inspects a document or thing produced to the court because of subsection (1) need not use the document in evidence.


Division 4 Examination in chief and re-examination
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### 37   Leading questions
(1)  A leading question must not be put to a witness in examination in chief or in re-examination unless:
(a)  the court gives leave, or
(b)  the question relates to a matter introductory to the witness’s evidence, or
(c)  no objection is made to the question and (leaving aside the party conducting the examination in chief or re-examination) each other party to the proceeding is represented by an Australian legal practitioner, legal counsel or prosecutor, or
(d)  the question relates to a matter that is not in dispute, or
(e)  if the witness has specialised knowledge based on the witness’s training, study or experience—the question is asked for the purpose of obtaining the witness’s opinion about a hypothetical statement of facts, being facts in respect of which evidence has been, or is intended to be, given.
(2)  Unless the court otherwise directs, subsection (1) does not apply in civil proceedings to a question that relates to an investigation, inspection or report that the witness made in the course of carrying out public or official duties.
(3)  Subsection (1) does not prevent a court from exercising power under rules of court to allow a written statement or report to be tendered or treated as evidence in chief of its maker.

    > *Note* Leading question is defined in the Dictionary.


#### 38   Unfavourable witnesses
(1)  A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:
(a)  evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or
(b)  a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or
(c)  whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.
(2)  Questioning a witness under this section is taken to be cross-examination for the purposes of this Act (other than section 39).
(3)  The party questioning the witness under this section may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness’s credibility.
        Note.
         The rules about admissibility of evidence relevant only to credibility are set out in Part 3.7.
(4)  Questioning under this section is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the court otherwise directs.
(5)  If the court so directs, the order in which the parties question the witness is to be as the court directs.
(6)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in determining whether to give leave or a direction under this section, it is to take into account:
(a)  whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave, and
(b)  the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party.
(7)  A party is subject to the same liability to be cross-examined under this section as any other witness if:
(a)  a proceeding is being conducted in the name of the party by or on behalf of an insurer or other person, and
(b)  the party is a witness in the proceeding.


#### 39   Limits on re-examination
On re-examination:
(a)  a witness may be questioned about matters arising out of evidence given by the witness in cross-examination, and
(b)  other questions may not be put to the witness unless the court gives leave.

Division 5 Cross-examination


#### 40   Witness called in error
A party is not to cross-examine a witness who has been called in error by another party and has not been questioned by that other party about a matter relevant to a question to be determined in the proceeding.


#### 41   Improper questions
(1)  The court must disallow a question put to a witness in cross-examination, or inform the witness that it need not be answered, if the court is of the opinion that the question (referred to as a disallowable question):
(a)  is misleading or confusing, or
(b)  is unduly annoying, harassing, intimidating, offensive, oppressive, humiliating or repetitive, or
(c)  is put to the witness in a manner or tone that is belittling, insulting or otherwise inappropriate, or
(d)  has no basis other than a stereotype (for example, a stereotype based on the witness’s sex, race, culture, ethnicity, age or mental, intellectual or physical disability).
(2)  Without limiting the matters the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to take into account:
(a)  any relevant condition or characteristic of the witness of which the court is, or is made, aware, including age, education, ethnic and cultural background, gender, language background and skills, level of maturity and understanding and personality, and
(b)  any mental, intellectual or physical disability of which the court is, or is made, aware and to which the witness is, or appears to be, subject, and
(c)  the context in which the question is put, including:
  (i)  the nature of the proceeding, and
  (ii)  in a criminal proceeding—the nature of the offence to which the proceeding relates, and
  (iii)  the relationship (if any) between the witness and any other party to the proceeding.
(3)  A question is not a disallowable question merely because:
(a)  the question challenges the truthfulness of the witness or the consistency or accuracy of any statement made by the witness, or
(b)  the question requires the witness to discuss a subject that could be considered distasteful to, or private by, the witness.
(4)  A party may object to a question put to a witness on the ground that it is a disallowable question.
(5)  However, the duty imposed on the court by this section applies whether or not an objection is raised to a particular question.
(6)  A failure by the court to disallow a question under this section, or to inform the witness that it need not be answered, does not affect the admissibility in evidence of any answer given by the witness in response to the question.

    > *Note* A person must not, without the express permission of a court, print or publish any question that the court has disallowed under this section—see section 195.


#### 42   Leading questions
(1)  A party may put a leading question to a witness in cross-examination unless the court disallows the question or directs the witness not to answer it.
(2)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to disallow the question or give such a direction, it is to take into account the extent to which:
(a)  evidence that has been given by the witness in examination in chief is unfavourable to the party who called the witness, and
(b)  the witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner, and
(c)  the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter, and
(d)  the witness’s age, or any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the witness is subject, may affect the witness’s answers.
(3)  The court is to disallow the question, or direct the witness not to answer it, if the court is satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used.
(4)  This section does not limit the court’s power to control leading questions.

    > *Note* Leading question is defined in the Dictionary.


#### 43   Prior inconsistent statements of witnesses
(1)  A witness may be cross-examined about a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness whether or not:
(a)  complete particulars of the statement have been given to the witness, or
(b)  a document containing a record of the statement has been shown to the witness.
(2)  If, in cross-examination, a witness does not admit that he or she has made a prior inconsistent statement, the cross-examiner is not to adduce evidence of the statement otherwise than from the witness unless, in the cross-examination, the cross-examiner:
(a)  informed the witness of enough of the circumstances of the making of the statement to enable the witness to identify the statement, and
(b)  drew the witness’s attention to so much of the statement as is inconsistent with the witness’s evidence.
(3)  For the purpose of adducing evidence of the statement, a party may re-open the party’s case.


#### 44   Previous representations of other persons
(1)  Except as provided by this section, a cross-examiner must not question a witness about a previous representation alleged to have been made by a person other than the witness.
(2)  A cross-examiner may question a witness about the representation and its contents if:
(a)  evidence of the representation has been admitted, or
(b)  the court is satisfied that it will be admitted.
(3)  If subsection (2) does not apply and the representation is contained in a document, the document may only be used to question a witness as follows:
(a)  the document must be produced to the witness,
(b)  if the document is a tape recording, or any other kind of document from which sounds are reproduced—the witness must be provided with the means (for example, headphones) to listen to the contents of the document without other persons present at the cross-examination hearing those contents,
(c)  the witness must be asked whether, having examined (or heard) the contents of the document, the witness stands by the evidence that he or she has given,
(d)  neither the cross-examiner nor the witness is to identify the document or disclose any of its contents.
(4)  A document that is so used may be marked for identification.


#### 45   Production of documents
(1)  This section applies if a party is cross-examining or has cross-examined a witness about:
(a)  a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness that is recorded in a document, or
(b)  a previous representation alleged to have been made by another person that is recorded in a document.
(2)  If the court so orders or if another party so requires, the party must produce:
(a)  the document, or
(b)  such evidence of the contents of the document as is available to the party,
    to the court or to that other party.
(3)  The court may:
(a)  examine a document or evidence that has been so produced, and
(b)  give directions as to its use, and
(c)  admit it even if it has not been tendered by a party.
(4)  Subsection (3) does not permit the court to admit a document or evidence that is not admissible because of Chapter 3.
(5)  The mere production of a document to a witness who is being cross-examined does not give rise to a requirement that the cross-examiner tender the document.


#### 46   Leave to recall witnesses
(1)  The court may give leave to a party to recall a witness to give evidence about a matter raised by evidence adduced by another party, being a matter on which the witness was not cross-examined, if the evidence concerned has been admitted and:
(a)  it contradicts evidence about the matter given by the witness in examination in chief, or
(b)  the witness could have given evidence about the matter in examination in chief.
(2)  A reference in this section to a matter raised by evidence adduced by another party includes a reference to an inference drawn from, or that the party intends to draw from, that evidence.


Part 2.2 Documents
===============================================================================


#### 47   Definitions
(1)  A reference in this Part to a document in question is a reference to a document as to the contents of which it is sought to adduce evidence.
(2)  A reference in this Part to a copy of a document in question includes a reference to a document that is not an exact copy of the document in question but that is identical to the document in question in all relevant respects.


#### 48   Proof of contents of documents
(1)  A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question by tendering the document in question or by any one or more of the following methods:
(a)  adducing evidence of an admission made by another party to the proceeding as to the contents of the document in question,
(b)  tendering a document that:
  (i)  is or purports to be a copy of the document in question, and
  (ii)  has been produced, or purports to have been produced, by a device that reproduces the contents of documents,
(c)  if the document in question is an article or thing by which words are recorded in such a way as to be capable of being reproduced as sound, or in which words are recorded in a code (including shorthand writing)—tendering a document that is or purports to be a transcript of the words,
(d)  if the document in question is an article or thing on or in which information is stored in such a way that it cannot be used by the court unless a device is used to retrieve, produce or collate it—tendering a document that was or purports to have been produced by use of the device,
(e)  tendering a document that:
  (i)  forms part of the records of or kept by a business (whether or not the business is still in existence), and
  (ii)  is or purports to be a copy of, or an extract from or a summary of, the document in question, or is or purports to be a copy of such an extract or summary,
(f)  if the document in question is a public document—tendering a document that is or purports to be a copy of the document in question and that is or purports to have been printed:
  (i)  by a person authorised by or on behalf of the government to print the document or by the Government Printer of the Commonwealth or by the government or official printer of another State or a Territory, or
  (ii)  by the authority of the Government or administration of the State, the Commonwealth, another State, a Territory or a foreign country, or
  (iii)  by authority of an Australian Parliament, a House of an Australian Parliament, a committee of such a House or a committee of an Australian Parliament.
(2)  Subsection (1) applies to a document in question whether the document in question is available to the party or not.
(3)  If the party adduces evidence of the contents of a document under subsection (1) (a), the evidence may only be used:
(a)  in respect of the party’s case against the other party who made the admission concerned, or
(b)  in respect of the other party’s case against the party who adduced the evidence in that way.
(4)  A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question that is not available to the party, or the existence and contents of which are not in issue in the proceeding, by:
(a)  tendering a document that is a copy of, or an extract from or summary of, the document in question, or
(b)  adducing from a witness evidence of the contents of the document in question.

    > *Notes*
    1   Clause 5 of Part 2 of the Dictionary is about the availability of documents.
    2   Section 182 of the Commonwealth Act gives section 48 of the Commonwealth Act a wider application in relation to Commonwealth records and certain Commonwealth documents.


#### 49   Documents in foreign countries
No paragraph of section 48 (1) (other than paragraph (a)) applies to a document that is in a foreign country unless:
(a)  the party who adduces evidence of the contents of the document in question has, not less than 28 days (or such other period as may be prescribed by the regulations or by rules of court) before the day on which the evidence is adduced, served on each other party a copy of the document proposed to be tendered, or
(b)  the court directs that it is to apply.

    > *Note* Section 182 of the Commonwealth Act gives section 49 of the Commonwealth Act a wider application in relation to Commonwealth records and certain Commonwealth documents.


#### 50   Proof of voluminous or complex documents
(1)  The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the party may adduce evidence of the contents of 2 or more documents in question in the form of a summary if the court is satisfied that it would not otherwise be possible conveniently to examine the evidence because of the volume or complexity of the documents in question.
(2)  The court may only make such a direction if the party seeking to adduce the evidence in the form of a summary has:
(a)  served on each other party a copy of the summary that discloses the name and address of the person who prepared the summary, and
(b)  given each other party a reasonable opportunity to examine or copy the documents in question.
(3)  The opinion rule does not apply to evidence adduced in accordance with a direction under this section.


#### 51   Original document rule abolished
The principles and rules of the common law that relate to the means of proving the contents of documents are abolished.
    Note.
     Section 182 of the Commonwealth Act gives the provisions of Part 2.2 of the Commonwealth Act a wider application in relation to Commonwealth records and certain Commonwealth documents.


Part 2.3 Other evidence
===============================================================================


#### 52   Adducing of other evidence not affected
This Act (other than this Part) does not affect the operation of any Australian law or rule of practice so far as it permits evidence to be adduced in a way other than by witnesses giving evidence or documents being tendered in evidence.


#### 53   Views
(1)  A judge may, on application, order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held.
(2)  A judge is not to make an order unless he or she is satisfied that:
(a)  the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and
(b)  the judge and, if there is a jury, the jury will be present.
(3)  Without limiting the matters that the judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following:
(a)  whether the parties will be present,
(b)  whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection will, in the court’s opinion, assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence,
(c)  the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time,
(d)  in the case of a demonstration—the extent to which the demonstration will properly reproduce the conduct or event to be demonstrated,
(e)  in the case of an inspection—the extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered.
(4)  The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) is not to conduct an experiment in the course of its deliberations.
(5)  This section does not apply in relation to the inspection of an exhibit by the court or, if there is a jury, by the jury.


#### 54   Views to be evidence
The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) may draw any reasonable inference from what it sees, hears or otherwise notices during a demonstration, experiment or inspection.


Chapter 3 Admissibility of evidence
===============================================================================


#### Introductory note:
Outline of this Chapter
This Chapter is about whether evidence adduced in a proceeding is admissible.
Part 3.1 sets out the general inclusionary rule that relevant evidence is admissible.
Part 3.2 is about the exclusion of hearsay evidence, and exceptions to the hearsay rule.
Part 3.3 is about exclusion of opinion evidence, and exceptions to the opinion rule.
Part 3.4 is about admissions and the extent to which they are admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule and the opinion rule.
Part 3.5 is about exclusion of certain evidence of judgments and convictions.
Part 3.6 is about exclusion of evidence of tendency or coincidence, and exceptions to the tendency rule and the coincidence rule.
Part 3.7 is about exclusion of evidence relevant only to credibility, and exceptions to the credibility rule.
Part 3.8 is about character evidence and the extent to which it is admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule.
Part 3.9 is about the requirements that must be satisfied before identification evidence is admissible.
Part 3.10 is about the various categories of privilege that may prevent evidence being adduced.
Part 3.11 provides for the discretionary and mandatory exclusion of evidence even if it would otherwise be admissible.
The following diagram shows how this Chapter applies to particular evidence:
Part 3.1 Relevance


#### 55   Relevant evidence
(1)  The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.
(2)  In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to:
(a)  the credibility of a witness, or
(b)  the admissibility of other evidence, or
(c)  a failure to adduce evidence.


#### 56   Relevant evidence to be admissible
(1)  Except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding.
(2)  Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.


#### 57   Provisional relevance
(1)  If the determination of the question whether evidence adduced by a party is relevant depends on the court making another finding (including a finding that the evidence is what the party claims it to be), the court may find that the evidence is relevant:
(a)  if it is reasonably open to make that finding, or
(b)  subject to further evidence being admitted at a later stage of the proceeding that will make it reasonably open to make that finding.
(2)  Without limiting subsection (1), if the relevance of evidence of an act done by a person depends on the court making a finding that the person and one or more other persons had, or were acting in furtherance of, a common purpose (whether to effect an unlawful conspiracy or otherwise), the court may use the evidence itself in determining whether the common purpose existed.


#### 58   Inferences as to relevance
(1)  If a question arises as to the relevance of a document or thing, the court may examine it and may draw any reasonable inference from it, including an inference as to its authenticity or identity.
(2)  Subsection (1) does not limit the matters from which inferences may properly be drawn.


Part 3.2 Hearsay
===============================================================================
Division 1 The hearsay rule
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### 59   The hearsay rule—exclusion of hearsay evidence
(1)  Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert by the representation.
(2)  Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an asserted fact.
(2A)  For the purposes of determining under subsection (1) whether it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert a particular fact by the representation, the court may have regard to the circumstances in which the representation was made.
    > *Note*  Subsection (2A) was inserted as a response to the decision of the Supreme Court of NSW in R v Hannes (2000) 158 FLR 359.
(3)  Subsection (1) does not apply to evidence of a representation contained in a certificate or other document given or made under regulations made under an Act other than this Act to the extent to which the regulations provide that the certificate or other document has evidentiary effect.

    > *Notes* Specific exceptions to the hearsay rule are as follows:
    •  evidence relevant for a non-hearsay purpose (section 60),
    •  first-hand hearsay:
        —  civil proceedings, if the maker of the representation is unavailable (section 63) or available (section 64)
        —  criminal proceedings, if the maker of the representation is unavailable (section 65) or available (section 66)
    •  contemporaneous statements about a person’s health etc (section 66A)
    •  business records (section 69)
    •  tags and labels (section 70)
    •  electronic communications (section 71)
    •  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander traditional laws and customs (section 72)
    •  marriage, family history or family relationships (section 73)
    •  public or general rights (section 74)
    •  use of evidence in interlocutory proceedings (section 75)
    •  admissions (section 81)
    •  representations about employment or authority (section 87 (2))
    •  exceptions to the rule excluding evidence of judgments and convictions (section 92 (3))
    •  character of and expert opinion about accused persons (sections 110 and 111).

    > Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as further exceptions.
    Examples:
    1  D is the defendant in a sexual assault trial. W has made a statement to the police that X told W that X had seen D leave a night club with the victim shortly before the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred. Unless an exception to the hearsay rule applies, evidence of what X told W cannot be given at the trial.
    2  P had told W that the handbrake on W’s car did not work. Unless an exception to the hearsay rule applies, evidence of that statement cannot be given by P, W or anyone else to prove that the handbrake was defective.
    3  W had bought a video cassette recorder and written down its serial number on a document. Unless an exception to the hearsay rule applies, the document is inadmissible to prove that a video cassette recorder later found in D’s possession was the video cassette recorder bought by W.


#### 60   Exception: evidence relevant for a non-hearsay purpose
(1)  The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of an asserted fact.
(2)  This section applies whether or not the person who made the representation had personal knowledge of the asserted fact (within the meaning of section 62 (2)).
    > *Note*  Subsection (2) was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594.
(3)  However, this section does not apply in a criminal proceeding to evidence of an admission.
    > *Note*  The admission might still be admissible under section 81 as an exception to the hearsay rule if it is “first-hand” hearsay: see section 82.


#### 61   Exceptions to the hearsay rule dependent on competency
(1)  This Part does not enable use of a previous representation to prove the existence of an asserted fact if, when the representation was made, the person who made it was not competent to give evidence about the fact because of section 13 (1).
(2)  This section does not apply to a contemporaneous representation made by a person about his or her health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind.
    > *Note*  For the admissibility of such contemporaneous representations, see section 66A.
(3)  For the purposes of this section, it is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that when the representation was made the person who made it was competent to give evidence about the asserted fact.


Division 2 “First-hand” hearsay
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### 62   Restriction to “first-hand” hearsay
(1)  A reference in this Division (other than in subsection (2)) to a previous representation is a reference to a previous representation that was made by a person who had personal knowledge of an asserted fact.
(2)  A person has personal knowledge of the asserted fact if his or her knowledge of the fact was, or might reasonably be supposed to have been, based on something that the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived, other than a previous representation made by another person about the fact.
(3)  For the purposes of section 66A, a person has personal knowledge of the asserted fact if it is a fact about the person’s health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind at the time the representation referred to in that section was made.


#### 63   Exception: civil proceedings if maker not available
(1)  This section applies in a civil proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.
(2)  The hearsay rule does not apply to:
(a)  evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or
(b)  a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.
    
    > *Notes*       
    1   Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.
    2   Clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary is about the availability of persons.


#### 64   Exception: civil proceedings if maker available
(1)  This section applies in a civil proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact.
(2)  The hearsay rule does not apply to:
(a)  evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or
(b)  a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation,

        if it would cause undue expense or undue delay, or would not be reasonably practicable, to call the person who made the representation to give evidence.
        Note.
         Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection. Section 68 is about objections to notices that relate to this subsection.
(3)  If the person who made the representation has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by:
(a)  that person, or
(b)  a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made.
(4)  A document containing a representation to which subsection (3) applies must not be tendered before the conclusion of the examination in chief of the person who made the representation, unless the court gives leave.

    Note.
     Clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary is about the availability of persons.


#### 65   Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available
(1)  This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.
(2)  The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:
(a)  was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or
(b)  was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or
(c)  was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or
(d)  was:
  (i)  against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and
  (ii)  made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.

        Note.
         Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.
(3)  The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied:
(a)  cross-examined the person who made the representation about it, or
(b)  had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the representation about it.

        Note.
         Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.
(4)  If there is more than one defendant in the criminal proceeding, evidence of a previous representation that:
(a)  is given in an Australian or overseas proceeding, and
(b)  is admitted into evidence in the criminal proceeding because of subsection (3),
    cannot be used against a defendant who did not cross-examine, and did not have a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine, the person about the representation.
(5)  For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), a defendant is taken to have had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine a person if the defendant was not present at a time when the cross-examination of a person might have been conducted but:
(a)  could reasonably have been present at that time, and
(b)  if present could have cross-examined the person.
(6)  Evidence of the making of a representation to which subsection (3) applies may be adduced by producing a transcript, or a recording, of the representation that is authenticated by:
(a)  the person to whom, or the court or other body to which, the representation was made, or
(b)  if applicable, the registrar or other proper officer of the court or other body to which the representation was made, or
(c)  the person or body responsible for producing the transcript or recording.
(7)  Without limiting subsection (2) (d), a representation is taken for the purposes of that subsection to be against the interests of the person who made it if it tends:
(a)  to damage the person’s reputation, or
(b)  to show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted, or
(c)  to show that the person is liable in an action for damages.
(8)  The hearsay rule does not apply to:
(a)  evidence of a previous representation adduced by a defendant if the evidence is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or
(b)  a document tendered as evidence by a defendant so far as it contains a previous representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.

        Note.
         Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.
(9)  If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:
(a)  is adduced by another party, and
(b)  is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made.

    Note.
     Clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary is about the availability of persons.



#### 66   Exception: criminal proceedings if maker available
(1)  This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact.
(2)  If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by:
(a)  that person, or
(b)  a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made,

        if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.
(2A)  In determining whether the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of a person, the court may take into account all matters that it considers are relevant to the question, including:
(a)  the nature of the event concerned, and
(b)  the age and health of the person, and
(c)  the period of time between the occurrence of the asserted fact and the making of the representation.

        Note.
         Subsection (2A) was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606.
(3)  If a representation was made for the purpose of indicating the evidence that the person who made it would be able to give in an Australian or overseas proceeding, subsection (2) does not apply to evidence adduced by the prosecutor of the representation unless the representation concerns the identity of a person, place or thing.
(4)  A document containing a representation to which subsection (2) applies must not be tendered before the conclusion of the examination in chief of the person who made the representation, unless the court gives leave.

    Note.
     Clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary is about the availability of persons.



#### 66A   Exception: contemporaneous statements about a person’s health etc
The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made by a person if the representation was a contemporaneous representation about the person’s health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind.


#### 67   Notice to be given
(1)  Sections 63 (2), 64 (2) and 65 (2), (3) and (8) do not apply to evidence adduced by a party unless that party has given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence.
(2)  Notices given under subsection (1) are to be given in accordance with any regulations or rules of court made for the purposes of this section.
(3)  The notice must state:
(a)  the particular provisions of this Division on which the party intends to rely in arguing that the hearsay rule does not apply to the evidence, and
(b)  if section 64 (2) is such a provision—the grounds, specified in that provision, on which the party intends to rely.
(4)  Despite subsection (1), if notice has not been given, the court may, on the application of a party, direct that one or more of those subsections is to apply despite the party’s failure to give notice.
(5)  The direction:
(a)  is subject to such conditions (if any) as the court thinks fit, and
(b)  in particular, may provide that, in relation to specified evidence, the subsection or subsections concerned apply with such modifications as the court specifies.


#### 68   Objections to tender of hearsay evidence in civil proceedings if maker available
(1)  In a civil proceeding, if the notice discloses that it is not intended to call the person who made the previous representation concerned because it:
(a)  would cause undue expense or undue delay, or
(b)  would not be reasonably practicable,

        a party may, not later than 21 days after notice has been given, object to the tender of the evidence, or of a specified part of the evidence.
(2)  The objection is to be made by giving to each other party a written notice setting out the grounds on which the objection is made.
(3)  The court may, on the application of a party, determine the objection at or before the hearing.
(4)  If the objection is unreasonable, the court may order that, in any event, the party objecting is to bear the costs incurred by another party:
(a)  in relation to the objection, and
(b)  in calling the person who made the representation to give evidence.

    Note.
     This subsection differs from section 68 (4) of the Commonwealth Act because of the different way costs are ascertained by NSW courts.

Division 3 Other exceptions to the hearsay rule


#### 69   Exception: business records
(1)  This section applies to a document that:
(a)  either:
  (i)  is or forms part of the records belonging to or kept by a person, body or organisation in the course of, or for the purposes of, a business, or
  (ii)  at any time was or formed part of such a record, and
(b)  contains a previous representation made or recorded in the document in the course of, or for the purposes of, the business.
(2)  The hearsay rule does not apply to the document (so far as it contains the representation) if the representation was made:
(a)  by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact, or
(b)  on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact.
(3)  Subsection (2) does not apply if the representation:
(a)  was prepared or obtained for the purpose of conducting, or for or in contemplation of or in connection with, an Australian or overseas proceeding, or
(b)  was made in connection with an investigation relating or leading to a criminal proceeding.
(4)  If:
(a)  the occurrence of an event of a particular kind is in question, and
(b)  in the course of a business, a system has been followed of making and keeping a record of the occurrence of all events of that kind,
    the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence that tends to prove that there is no record kept, in accordance with that system, of the occurrence of the event.
(5)  For the purposes of this section, a person is taken to have had personal knowledge of a fact if the person’s knowledge of the fact was or might reasonably be supposed to have been based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived (other than a previous representation made by a person about the fact).

    Notes.
     
    1   Sections 48, 49, 50, 146, 147 and 150 (1) are relevant to the mode of proof, and authentication, of business records.
    2   Section 182 of the Commonwealth Act gives section 69 of the Commonwealth Act a wider application in relation to Commonwealth records.



#### 70   Exception: contents of tags, labels and writing
The hearsay rule does not apply to a tag or label attached to, or writing placed on, an object (including a document) if the tag or label or writing may reasonably be supposed to have been so attached or placed:
(a)  in the course of a business, and
(b)  for the purpose of describing or stating the identity, nature, ownership, destination, origin or weight of the object, or of the contents (if any) of the object.

    Note.
     The Commonwealth Act has an additional subsection. It provides that the exception does not apply to Customs and Excise prosecutions. Section 5 of the Commonwealth Act extends the application of that subsection to proceedings in all Australian courts.



#### 71   Exception: electronic communications
The hearsay rule does not apply to a representation contained in a document recording an electronic communication so far as the representation is a representation as to:
(a)  the identity of the person from whom or on whose behalf the communication was sent, or
(b)  the date on which or the time at which the communication was sent, or
(c)  the destination of the communication or the identity of the person to whom the communication was addressed.

    Notes.
     
    1   Division 3 of Part 4.3 contains presumptions about electronic communications.
    2   Section 182 of the Commonwealth Act gives section 71 of the Commonwealth Act a wider application in relation to Commonwealth records.
    3   Electronic communication is defined in the Dictionary.


#### 72   Exception: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander traditional laws and customs
The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a representation about the existence or non-existence, or the content, of the traditional laws and customs of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group.

(c)  a person’s age, or
(d)  family history or a family relationship.
(2)  In a criminal proceeding, subsection (1) does not apply to evidence adduced by a defendant unless:

(1)  The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of reputation concerning the existence, nature or extent of a public or general right.
(2)  In a criminal proceeding, subsection (1) does not apply to evidence adduced by the prosecutor unless it tends to contradict evidence of a kind referred to in subsection (1) that has been admitted.

Part 3.3 Opinion


#### 76   The opinion rule
(1)  Evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.
(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to evidence of an opinion contained in a certificate or other document given or made under regulations made under an Act other than this Act to the extent to which the regulations provide that the certificate or other document has evidentiary effect.

    Note.
     Specific exceptions to the opinion rule are as follows:
        •  summaries of voluminous or complex documents (section 50 (3))
        •  evidence relevant otherwise than as opinion evidence (section 77)

        •  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander traditional laws and customs (section 78A)
        •  expert opinion (section 79)
        •  admissions (section 81)
        •  exceptions to the rule excluding evidence of judgments and convictions (section 92 (3))
        •  character of and expert opinion about accused persons (sections 110 and 111).

    Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as further exceptions.
    Examples:

        1  P sues D, her doctor, for the negligent performance of a surgical operation. Unless an exception to the opinion rule applies, P’s neighbour, W, who had the same operation, cannot give evidence of his opinion that D had not performed the operation as well as his own.

        2  P considers that electrical work that D, an electrician, has done for her is unsatisfactory. Unless an exception to the opinion rule applies, P cannot give evidence of her opinion that D does not have the necessary skills to do electrical work.



#### 77   Exception: evidence relevant otherwise than as opinion evidence
The opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.


#### 78   Exception: lay opinionsThe opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion expressed by a person if:
(a)  the opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about a matter or event, and

(1)  If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.
(2)  To avoid doubt, and without limiting subsection (1):
(a)  a reference in that subsection to specialised knowledge includes a reference to specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour (including specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their development and behaviour during and following the abuse), and
(b)  a reference in that subsection to an opinion of a person includes, if the person has specialised knowledge of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), a reference to an opinion relating to either or both of the following:
  (i)  the development and behaviour of children generally,
  (ii)  the development and behaviour of children who have been victims of sexual offences, or offences similar to sexual offences.


#### 80   Ultimate issue and common knowledge rules abolished

(b)  a matter of common knowledge.

Part 3.4 Admissions

#### 81   Hearsay and opinion rules: exception for admissions and related representations
(1)  The hearsay rule and the opinion rule do not apply to evidence of an admission.
(2)  The hearsay rule and the opinion rule do not apply to evidence of a previous representation:
(a)  that was made in relation to an admission at the time the admission was made, or shortly before or after that time, and
(b)  to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the admission.
    Note.

        •  records of oral questioning of accused persons (section 86)

    Example:

        D admits to W, his best friend, that he sexually assaulted V. In D’s trial for the sexual assault, the prosecution may lead evidence from W:
(a)  that D made the admission to W as proof of the truth of that admission, and
(b)  that W formed the opinion that D was sane when he made the admission.


#### 82   Exclusion of evidence of admissions that is not first-hand
    Section 81 does not prevent the application of the hearsay rule to evidence of an admission unless:
(a)  it is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made, or
(b)  it is a document in which the admission is made.

    Note.
     Section 60 does not apply in a criminal proceeding to evidence of an admission.


#### 83   Exclusion of evidence of admissions as against third parties
(1)  Section 81 does not prevent the application of the hearsay rule or the opinion rule to evidence of an admission in respect of the case of a third party.
(2)  The evidence may be used in respect of the case of a third party if that party consents.
(3)  Consent cannot be given in respect of part only of the evidence.
(4)  In this section:
        third party means a party to the proceeding concerned, other than the party who:
(a)  made the admission, or
(b)  adduced the evidence.


#### 84   Exclusion of admissions influenced by violence and certain other conduct
(1)  Evidence of an admission is not admissible unless the court is satisfied that the admission, and the making of the admission, were not influenced by:
(a)  violent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading conduct, whether towards the person who made the admission or towards another person, or
(b)  a threat of conduct of that kind.
(2)  Subsection (1) only applies if the party against whom evidence of the admission is adduced has raised in the proceeding an issue about whether the admission or its making were so influenced.


#### 85   Criminal proceedings: reliability of admissions by defendants
(1)  This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant:
(a)  to, or in the presence of, an investigating official who at that time was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence, or
(b)  as a result of an act of another person who was, and who the defendant knew or reasonably believed to be, capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought or should be continued.

        Note.
         Subsection (1) was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Kelly v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 216.
(2)  Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.
(3)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (2), it is to take into account:
(a)  any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be subject, and
(b)  if the admission was made in response to questioning:
  (i)  the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put, and
  (ii)  the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the person questioned.


#### 86   Exclusion of records of oral questioning
(1)  This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only if an oral admission was made by a defendant to an investigating official in response to a question put or a representation made by the official.
(2)  A document prepared by or on behalf of the official is not admissible to prove the contents of the question, representation or response unless the defendant has acknowledged that the document is a true record of the question, representation or response.
(3)  The acknowledgement must be made by signing, initialling or otherwise marking the document.
(4)  In this section:
        document does not include:
(a)  a sound recording, or a transcript of a sound recording, or
(b)  a recording of visual images and sounds, or a transcript of the sounds so recorded.


#### 87   Admissions made with authority
(1)  For the purpose of determining whether a previous representation made by a person is also taken to be an admission by a party, the court is to admit the representation if it is reasonably open to find that:
(a)  when the representation was made, the person had authority to make statements on behalf of the party in relation to the matter with respect to which the representation was made, or
(b)  when the representation was made, the person was an employee of the party, or had authority otherwise to act for the party, and the representation related to a matter within the scope of the person’s employment or authority, or
(c)  the representation was made by the person in furtherance of a common purpose (whether lawful or not) that the person had with the party or one or more persons including the party.
(2)  For the purposes of this section, the hearsay rule does not apply to a previous representation made by a person that tends to prove:
(a)  that the person had authority to make statements on behalf of another person in relation to a matter, or
(b)  that the person was an employee of another person or had authority otherwise to act for another person, or
(c)  the scope of the person’s employment or authority.


#### 88   Proof of admissions
For the purpose of determining whether evidence of an admission is admissible, the court is to find that a particular person made the admission if it is reasonably open to find that he or she made the admission.


#### 89   Evidence of silence generally
(1)  Subject to section 89A, in a criminal proceeding, an inference unfavourable to a party must not be drawn from evidence that the party or another person failed or refused:
(a)  to answer one or more questions, or
(b)  to respond to a representation,
    put or made to the party or other person by an investigating official who at that time was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence.
(2)  Evidence of that kind is not admissible if it can only be used to draw such an inference.
(3)  Subsection (1) does not prevent use of the evidence to prove that the party or other person failed or refused to answer the question or to respond to the representation if the failure or refusal is a fact in issue in the proceeding.
(4)  In this section:
        inference includes:
(a)  an inference of consciousness of guilt, or
(b)  an inference relevant to a party’s credibility.


#### 89A   Evidence of silence in criminal proceedings for serious indictable offences
(1)  In a criminal proceeding for a serious indictable offence, such unfavourable inferences may be drawn as appear proper from evidence that, during official questioning in relation to the offence, the defendant failed or refused to mention a fact:
(a)  that the defendant could reasonably have been expected to mention in the circumstances existing at the time, and
(b)  that is relied on in his or her defence in that proceeding.
(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply unless:
(a)  a special caution was given to the defendant by an investigating official who, at the time the caution was given, had reasonable cause to suspect that the defendant had committed the serious indictable offence, and
(b)  the special caution was given before the failure or refusal to mention the fact, and
(c)  the special caution was given in the presence of an Australian legal practitioner who was acting for the defendant at that time, and
(d)  the defendant had, before the failure or refusal to mention the fact, been allowed a reasonable opportunity to consult with that Australian legal practitioner, in the absence of the investigating official, about the general nature and effect of special cautions.
(3)  It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving a special caution.
(4)  An investigating official must not give a special caution to a person being questioned in relation to an offence unless satisfied that the offence is a serious indictable offence.
(5)  This section does not apply:
(a)  to a defendant who, at the time of the official questioning, is under 18 years of age or is incapable of understanding the general nature and effect of a special caution, or
(b)  if evidence of the failure or refusal to mention the fact is the only evidence that the defendant is guilty of the serious indictable offence.
(6)  The provisions of this section are in addition to any other provisions relating to a person being cautioned before being investigated for an offence that the person does not have to say or do anything. The special caution may be given after or in conjunction with that caution.
        Note.
         See section 139 of this Act and section 122 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002.
(7)  Nothing in this section precludes the drawing of any inference from evidence of silence that could properly be drawn apart from this section.
(8)  The giving of a special caution in accordance with this section in relation to a serious indictable offence does not of itself make evidence obtained after the giving of the special caution inadmissible in proceedings for any other offence (whether or not a serious indictable offence).
(9)  In this section:
        official questioning of a defendant in relation to a serious indictable offence means questions put to the defendant by an investigating official who at that time was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of the serious indictable offence.
        special caution means a caution given to a person that is to the effect that:
(a)  the person does not have to say or do anything, but it may harm the person’s defence if the person does not mention when questioned something the person later relies on in court, and
(b)  anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.

    Note.
     The Commonwealth Act does not include this section.



#### 90   Discretion to exclude admissions
In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if:
(a)  the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and
(b)  having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.

    Note.
     Part 3.11 contains other exclusionary discretions that are applicable to admissions.

Part 3.5 Evidence of judgments and convictions


#### 91   Exclusion of evidence of judgments and convictions
(1)  Evidence of the decision, or of a finding of fact, in an Australian or overseas proceeding is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that was in issue in that proceeding.
(2)  Evidence that, under this Part, is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact may not be used to prove that fact even if it is relevant for another purpose.

    Note.
     Section 178 (Convictions, acquittals and other judicial proceedings) provides for certificate evidence of decisions.


#### 92   Exceptions
(1)  Section 91 (1) does not prevent the admission or use of evidence of the grant of probate, letters of administration or a similar order of a court to prove:

(b)  that has been quashed or set aside, or
(c)  in respect of which a pardon has been given.
(3)  The hearsay rule and the opinion rule do not apply to evidence of a kind referred to in this section.

(1)  Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.
(2)  Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.


#### 96   Failure to act
A reference in this Part to doing an act includes a reference to failing to do that act.


#### 97   The tendency rule
(1)  Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:
(a)  the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and
(b)  the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.
(2)  Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:
(a)  the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or
(b)  the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.

    Note.
     The tendency rule is subject to specific exceptions concerning character of and expert opinion about accused persons (sections 110 and 111). Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as further exceptions.


#### 98   The coincidence rule
(1)  Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:
(a)  the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and
(b)  the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

        Note.
         One of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding.
(2)  Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:
(a)  the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or
(b)  the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.

        Note.

(2)  The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the coincidence rule is not to apply to particular coincidence evidence despite the party’s failure to give notice under section 98.
(3)  The application may be made either before or after the time by which the party would, apart from this section, be required to give, or to have given, the notice.
(4)  In a civil proceeding, the party’s application may be made without notice of it having been given to one or more of the other parties.
(5)  The direction:
(a)  is subject to such conditions (if any) as the court thinks fit, and
(b)  may be given either at or before the hearing.
(6)  Without limiting the court’s power to impose conditions under this section, those conditions may include one or more of the following:
(a)  a condition that the party give notice of its intention to adduce the evidence to a specified party, or to each other party other than a specified party,
(b)  a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified tendency evidence, or all tendency evidence that the party intends to adduce other than specified tendency evidence,
(c)  a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified coincidence evidence, or all coincidence evidence that the party intends to adduce other than specified coincidence evidence.


#### 101   Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution
(1)  This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.
(2)  Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(4)  This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.

Part 3.7 Credibility
Division 1 Credibility evidence


#### 101A   Credibility evidence
Credibility evidence, in relation to a witness or other person, is evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness or person that:
(a)  is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, or
(b)  is relevant:
(i)  because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, and
(ii)  for some other purpose for which it is not admissible, or cannot be used, because of a provision of Parts 3.2 to 3.6.

    Notes. 
    1   Sections 60 and 77 will not affect the application of paragraph (b), because they cannot apply to evidence that is yet to be admitted.
    2   Section 101A was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Adam v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 96.

Division 2 Credibility of witnesses
102   The credibility rule

    Credibility evidence about a witness is not admissible.
    Notes.
    
    1   Specific exceptions to the credibility rule are as follows:
        •  evidence adduced in cross-examination (sections 103 and 104)
        •  evidence in rebuttal of denials (section 106)
        •  evidence to re-establish credibility (section 108)
        •  evidence of persons with specialised knowledge (section 108C)
        •  character of accused persons (section 110)
    Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as further exceptions.
    2   Sections 108A and 108B deal with the admission of credibility evidence about a person who has made a previous representation but is not a witness.


#### 103   Exception: cross-examination as to credibility
(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.
(2)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to:
(a)  whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and
(b)  the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.

104   Further protections: cross-examination as to credibility
(1)  This section applies only to credibility evidence in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to section 103.
(2)  A defendant must not be cross-examined about a matter that is relevant to the assessment of the defendant’s credibility, unless the court gives leave.
(3)  Despite subsection (2), leave is not required for cross-examination by the prosecutor about whether the defendant:
(a)  is biased or has a motive to be untruthful, or
(b)  is, or was, unable to be aware of or recall matters to which his or her evidence relates, or
(c)  has made a prior inconsistent statement.

#### 105   Further protections: defendants making unsworn statements

    * * * * *
    Note.
     The Commonwealth Act includes a provision that will only apply in proceedings in a federal court sitting in Norfolk Island. It sets out the situations in which where a defendant in a criminal proceeding has made an unsworn statement evidence may be adduced from a person relating solely to the credibility of the defendant.


#### 106   Exception: rebutting denials by other evidence
(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence that is relevant to a witness’s credibility and that is adduced otherwise than from the witness if:
(a)  in cross-examination of the witness:
  (i)  the substance of the evidence was put to the witness, and
  (ii)  the witness denied, or did not admit or agree to, the substance of the evidence, and
(b)  the court gives leave to adduce the evidence.
(2)  Leave under subsection (1) (b) is not required if the evidence tends to prove that the witness:
(a)  is biased or has a motive for being untruthful, or
(b)  has been convicted of an offence, including an offence against the law of a foreign country, or
(c)  has made a prior inconsistent statement, or
(d)  is, or was, unable to be aware of matters to which his or her evidence relates, or
(e)  has knowingly or recklessly made a false representation while under an obligation, imposed by or under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country, to tell the truth.


#### 107   (Repealed)


#### 108   Exception: re-establishing credibility
(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness.
(2)    (Repealed)
        Note.
         The Commonwealth Act includes a subsection referring to section 105 of that Act.
(3)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if:
(a)  evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or
(b)  it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion,

        and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.

Division 3 Credibility of persons who are not witnesses


#### 108A   Admissibility of evidence of credibility of person who has made a previous representation
(1)  If:
(a)  evidence of a previous representation has been admitted in a proceeding, and
(b)  the person who made the representation has not been called, and will not be called, to give evidence in the proceeding,

        credibility evidence about the person who made the representation is not admissible unless the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the person’s credibility.
(2)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to:
(a)  whether the evidence tends to prove that the person who made the representation knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the person was under an obligation to tell the truth, and
(b)  the period that elapsed between the doing of the acts or the occurrence of the events to which the representation related and the making of the representation.


#### 108B   Further protections: previous representations of an accused who is not a witness
(1)  This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to section 108A.
(2)  If the person referred to in that section is a defendant, the credibility evidence is not admissible unless the court gives leave.
(3)  Despite subsection (2), leave is not required if the evidence is about whether the defendant:
(a)  is biased or has a motive to be untruthful, or
(b)  is, or was, unable to be aware of or recall matters to which his or her previous representation relates, or
(c)  has made a prior inconsistent statement.
(4)  The prosecution must not be given leave under subsection (2) unless evidence adduced by the defendant has been admitted that:
(a)  tends to prove that a witness called by the prosecution has a tendency to be untruthful, and
(b)  is relevant solely or mainly to the witness’s credibility.
(5)  A reference in subsection (4) to evidence does not include a reference to evidence of conduct in relation to:
(a)  the events in relation to which the defendant is being prosecuted, or
(b)  the investigation of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted.
(6)  Another defendant must not be given leave under subsection (2) unless the previous representation of the defendant that has been admitted includes evidence adverse to the defendant seeking leave.

(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence given by a person concerning the credibility of another witness if:
(a)  the person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, and
(b)  the evidence is evidence of an opinion of the person that:
  (i)  is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge, and
  (ii)  could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness, and
(c)  the court gives leave to adduce the evidence.
(2)  To avoid doubt, and without limiting subsection (1):
(a)  a reference in that subsection to specialised knowledge includes a reference to specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour (including specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their behaviour during and following the abuse), and
(b)  a reference in that subsection to an opinion of a person includes, if the person has specialised knowledge of that kind, a reference to an opinion relating to either or both of the following:
  (i)  the development and behaviour of children generally,
  (ii)  the development and behaviour of children who have been victims of sexual offences, or offences similar to sexual offences.

(2)  If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is generally a person of good character has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not generally a person of good character.
(3)  If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is a person of good character in a particular respect has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not a person of good character in that respect.

    > *Note* The Commonwealth Act includes an additional subsection relating to unsworn statements.


#### 111   Evidence about character of co-accused

Part 3.9 Identification evidence
Note.
 Identification evidence is defined in the Dictionary.


#### 113   Application of Part
This Part applies only in a criminal proceeding.


#### 114   Exclusion of visual identification evidence
(1)  In this section:
        visual identification evidence means identification evidence relating to an identification based wholly or partly on what a person saw but does not include picture identification evidence.
(2)  Visual identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible unless:
(a)  an identification parade that included the defendant was held before the identification was made, or
(b)  it would not have been reasonable to have held such a parade, or
(c)  the defendant refused to take part in such a parade,

        and the identification was made without the person who made it having been intentionally influenced to identify the defendant.
(3)  Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court in determining whether it was reasonable to hold an identification parade, it is to take into account:
(a)  the kind of offence, and the gravity of the offence, concerned, and
(b)  the importance of the evidence, and
(c)  the practicality of holding an identification parade having regard, among other things:
  (i)  if the defendant failed to cooperate in the conduct of the parade—to the manner and extent of, and the reason (if any) for, the failure, and
  (ii)  in any case—to whether the identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence, and
(d)  the appropriateness of holding an identification parade having regard, among other things, to the relationship (if any) between the defendant and the person who made the identification.
(4)  It is presumed that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade if it would have been unfair to the defendant for such a parade to have been held.
(5)  If:
(a)  the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade unless an Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel acting for the defendant, or another person chosen by the defendant, was present while it was being held, and
(b)  there were, at the time when the parade was to have been conducted, reasonable grounds to believe that it was not reasonably practicable for such an Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel or person to be present,

        it is presumed that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade at that time.
(6)  In determining whether it was reasonable to have held an identification parade, the court is not to take into account the availability of pictures or photographs that could be used in making identifications.


#### 115   Exclusion of evidence of identification by pictures
(1)  In this section:
        picture identification evidence means identification evidence relating to an identification made wholly or partly by the person who made the identification examining pictures kept for the use of police officers.

(3)  Subject to subsection (4), picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible if:
(a)  when the pictures were examined, the defendant was in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence with which the defendant has been charged, and
(b)  the picture of the defendant that was examined was made before the defendant was taken into that police custody.
(4)  Subsection (3) does not apply if:
(a)  the defendant’s appearance had changed significantly between the time when the offence was committed and the time when the defendant was taken into that custody, or
(b)  it was not reasonably practicable to make a picture of the defendant after the defendant was taken into that custody.
(5)  Picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible if, when the pictures were examined, the defendant was in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence with which the defendant has been charged, unless:
(a)  the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade, or
(b)  the defendant’s appearance had changed significantly between the time when the offence was committed and the time when the defendant was taken into that custody, or
(c)  it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade that included the defendant.
(6)  Sections 114 (3), (4), (5) and (6) apply in determining, for the purposes of subsection (5) (c) of this section, whether it would have been reasonable to have held an identification parade.
(7)  If picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is admitted into evidence, the judge must, on the request of the defendant:
(a)  if the picture of the defendant was made after the defendant was taken into that custody—inform the jury that the picture was made after the defendant was taken into that custody, or
(b)  otherwise—warn the jury that they must not assume that the defendant has a criminal record or has previously been charged with an offence.

        Note.
         Sections 116 (Directions to jury) and 165 (Unreliable evidence) also deal with warnings about identification evidence.
(8)  This section does not render inadmissible picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor that contradicts or qualifies picture identification evidence adduced by the defendant.
(9)  This section applies in addition to section 114.
(10)  In this section:
(a)  a reference to a picture includes a reference to a photograph, and
(b)  a reference to making a picture includes a reference to taking a photograph.


#### 116   Directions to jury
(1)  If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury:
(a)  that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence, and
(b)  of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case.
(2)  It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in so informing the jury.

        religious confession means a confession made by a person to a member of the clergy in the member’s professional capacity according to the ritual of the church or religious denomination concerned.



#### 128   Privilege in respect of self-incrimination in other proceedings
(1)  This section applies if a witness objects to giving particular evidence, or evidence on a particular matter, on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that the witness:
(a)  has committed an offence against or arising under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country, or
(b)  is liable to a civil penalty.
(2)  The court must determine whether or not there are reasonable grounds for the objection.
(3)  Subject to subsection (4), if the court determines that there are reasonable grounds for the objection, the court is not to require the witness to give the evidence, and is to inform the witness:
(a)  that the witness need not give the evidence unless required by the court to do so under subsection (4), and
(b)  that the court will give a certificate under this section if:
  (i)  the witness willingly gives the evidence without being required to do so under subsection (4), or
  (ii)  the witness gives the evidence after being required to do so under subsection (4), and
(c)  of the effect of such a certificate.
(4)  The court may require the witness to give the evidence if the court is satisfied that:

(b)  the person objects to giving that information or providing that document,

        the court must determine the objection by applying the provisions of this Part (other than sections 123 and 128) with any necessary modifications as if the objection to giving information or producing the document were an objection to the giving or adducing of evidence.

Part 3.11 Discretionary and mandatory exclusions


#### 135   General discretion to exclude evidence
The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:
(a)  be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or
(b)  be misleading or confusing, or
(c)  cause or result in undue waste of time.


#### 136   General discretion to limit use of evidence
The court may limit the use to be made of evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might:
(a)  be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or
(b)  be misleading or confusing.


#### 137   Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings
In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.


#### 138   Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence
(1)  Evidence that was obtained:
(a)  improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or
(b)  in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,

        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.
(2)  Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:
(a)  did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or
(b)  made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.
(3)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:
(a)  the probative value of the evidence, and
(b)  the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and
(c)  the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and
(d)  the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and
(e)  whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and
(f)  whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and

(h)  the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.

#### 139   Cautioning of persons
(1)  For the purposes of section 138 (1) (a), evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if:
(a)  the person was under arrest for an offence at the time, and
(b)  the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who was at the time empowered, because of the office that he or she held, to arrest the person, and
(c)  before starting the questioning the investigating official did not caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.
(2)  For the purposes of section 138 (1) (a), evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if:
(a)  the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who did not have the power to arrest the person, and
(b)  the statement was made, or the act was done, after the investigating official formed a belief that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed an offence, and
(c)  the investigating official did not, before the statement was made or the act was done, caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.
(3)  The caution must be given in, or translated into, a language in which the person is able to communicate with reasonable fluency, but need not be given in writing unless the person cannot hear adequately.
(4)  Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not apply so far as any Australian law requires the person to answer questions put by, or do things required by, the investigating official.
(5)  A reference in subsection (1) to a person who is under arrest includes a reference to a person who is in the company of an investigating official for the purpose of being questioned, if:
(a)  the official believes that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed an offence that is to be the subject of the questioning, or
(b)  the official would not allow the person to leave if the person wished to do so, or
(c)  the official has given the person reasonable grounds for believing that the person would not be allowed to leave if he or she wished to do so.
(6)  A person is not treated as being under arrest only because of subsection (5) if:
(a)  the official is performing functions in relation to persons or goods entering or leaving Australia and the official does not believe the person has committed an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or
(b)  the official is exercising a power under an Australian law to detain and search the person or to require the person to provide information or to answer questions.

(2)  If it is reasonably open to find that the device or process is one that, or is of a kind that, if properly used, ordinarily produces that outcome, it is presumed (unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is adduced) that, in producing the document or thing on the occasion in question, the device or process produced that outcome.

    Note.
     Example:

        It would not be necessary to call evidence to prove that a photocopier normally produced complete copies of documents and that it was working properly when it was used to photocopy a particular document.

        it is presumed (unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is adduced) that, in producing the document on the occasion in question, the device or process produced that outcome.
(3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to the contents of a document that was produced:
(a)  for the purpose of conducting, or for or in contemplation of or in connection with, an Australian or overseas proceeding, or

(a)  warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and

    Note.
     The Commonwealth Act does not include subsection (6).

(a)  warn the jury, or suggest to the jury, that children as a class are unreliable witnesses,
(b)  warn the jury, or suggest to the jury, that the evidence of children as a class is inherently less credible or reliable, or requires more careful scrutiny, than the evidence of adults,
(c)  give a warning, or suggestion to the jury, about the unreliability of the particular child’s evidence solely on account of the age of the child,
(d)  in the case of a criminal proceeding—give a general warning to the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a witness who is a child.
(2)  Subsection (1) does not prevent the judge, at the request of a party, from:
(a)  informing the jury that the evidence of the particular child may be unreliable and the reasons why it may be unreliable, and

(4)  It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in informing the jury of the nature of the significant forensic disadvantage suffered and the need to take that disadvantage into account, but the judge must not in any way suggest to the jury that it would be dangerous or unsafe to convict the defendant solely because of the delay or the forensic disadvantage suffered because of the consequences of the delay.
(5)  The judge must not warn or inform the jury about any forensic disadvantage the defendant may have suffered because of delay except in accordance with this section, but this section does not affect any other power of the judge to give any warning to, or to inform, the jury.
(6)  For the purposes of this section:
(a)  delay includes delay between the alleged offence and its being reported, and
(b)  significant forensic disadvantage is not to be regarded as being established by the mere existence of a delay.

    * * * * *
    Note.

(a)  answer a question or give information, or
(b)  produce a document or any other thing, or
(c)  do any other act whatever.
(2)  The body corporate is not entitled to refuse or fail to comply with the requirement on the ground that answering the question, giving the information, producing the document or other thing or doing that other act, as the case may be, might tend to incriminate the body or make the body liable to a penalty.

The court may direct that a document that has been tendered or produced before the court (whether or not it is admitted in evidence) is to be impounded and kept in the custody of an officer of the court or of another person for such period, and subject to such conditions, as the court thinks fit.


#### 189   The voir dire
(1)  If the determination of a question whether:
(a)  evidence should be admitted (whether in the exercise of a discretion or not), or
(b)  evidence can be used against a person, or
(c)  a witness is competent or compellable,

        depends on the court finding that a particular fact exists, the question whether that fact exists is, for the purposes of this section, a preliminary question.
(2)  If there is a jury, a preliminary question whether:
(a)  particular evidence is evidence of an admission, or evidence to which section 138 (Discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence) applies, or

        is to be heard and determined in the jury’s absence.
(3)  In the hearing of a preliminary question about whether a defendant’s admission should be admitted into evidence (whether in the exercise of a discretion or not) in a criminal proceeding, the issue of the admission’s truth or untruth is to be disregarded unless the issue is introduced by the defendant.
(4)  If there is a jury, the jury is not to be present at a hearing to decide any other preliminary question unless the court so orders.
(5)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to make such an order, it is to take into account:

(b)  whether the evidence concerned will be adduced in the course of the hearing to decide the preliminary question, and
(c)  whether the evidence to be adduced in the course of that hearing would be admitted if adduced at another stage of the hearing (other than in another hearing to decide a preliminary question or, in a criminal proceeding, a hearing in relation to sentencing).

(b)  the court is satisfied that the defendant understands the consequences of giving the consent.
(3)  In a civil proceeding, the court may order that any one or more of the provisions mentioned in subsection (1) do not apply in relation to evidence if:
(a)  the matter to which the evidence relates is not genuinely in dispute, or
(b)  the application of those provisions would cause or involve unnecessary expense or delay.
(4)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to exercise the power conferred by subsection (3), it is to take into account:
(a)  the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and
(b)  the nature of the cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and
(c)  the probative value of the evidence, and
(d)  the powers of the court (if any) to adjourn the hearing, to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.

192   Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms
(1)  If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.
(2)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:
(a)  the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and
(b)  the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and
(c)  the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and
(d)  the nature of the proceeding, and
(e)  the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.

(4)  Without limiting subsection (2), rules made under that subsection may provide for the exclusion of evidence, or for its admission on specified terms, if the rules are not complied with.


#### 194   Witnesses failing to attend proceedings

(a)  order the witness to show cause at those or later proceedings why execution of the recognisance or an attachment for disobedience to the summons or subpoena should not be issued against the witness, or
(b)  if it is proved that the non-appearance is without just cause or reasonable excuse and that the witness will probably be able to give relevant evidence in the proceeding, issue a warrant to bring the witness before the court to give the evidence.
(2)  Matters may be proved under this section orally or by affidavit.
(3)  On return of an order to show cause under this section the court may deal with the case in the same way as the Supreme Court would deal with an order to similar effect made by that Court.
(4)  In this section, recognisance includes a bail acknowledgment within the meaning of the Bail Act 2013.

    A person must not, without the express permission of a court, print or publish:
(a)  any question that the court has disallowed under section 41 (Improper questions), or
(b)  any question that the court has disallowed because any answer that is likely to be given to the question would contravene the credibility rule, or
(c)  any question in respect of which the court has refused to give leave under Part 3.7 (Credibility).
    Maximum penalty: 60 penalty units.
