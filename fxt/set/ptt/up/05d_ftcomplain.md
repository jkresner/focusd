Our tenant in unit 2 has emailed that they arrived home last night to find water surging out of the bathroom floor waste to the hallway and lounge room and then to bedroom.

The tenant called your three strata plumbers 3 times each and no-one answered their phones or called the tenants back.

The tenants therefore called our emergency plumber who attended the site from 1.00 am to 3.00 am and jet blasted the blocked sewer stack and rectified the issue.
