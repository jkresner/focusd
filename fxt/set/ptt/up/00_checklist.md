### Stalking

- Didn't want to got to O'Neill office sent lawyer






# 474.15

## Background

At the mercy of O'Neill Strata Management *(OSM)* and my Strata Committee *(SC)*:

|                     |                     |
|---------------------|---------------------|
|**Feb 2017 - Dec 2017** I was homeless due to a decade of water leaking and irresponsible building maintenance. Concrete cancer had spread all through my apartment floor and the rusted steal bars had to be exposed by jackhammer and treated. Strata were not in a rush to fix the apartment properly, nor transparent over the extent of damage and how long the repairs would take. I literally did not know where I should sleep from week to week and asked hundreds of times for a schedule without answer.|*![Homeless](/atchd/15d3ed07bc923a23__IMG_6168.jpg__inln.jpg)*|
|**May 2017** After requesting a General Meeting agenda item to discuss Strata Manager accountability, OSM illegitimately revoked my voting rights and distributed minutes to all my neighbors saying that I was "*unfinancial*" when I had paid my building levies, even though I didn't have access to my own home.|*![Unfinancial](/img/unfinancial.png)*|
|**Jun 2017** After 2 months notice and 15+ written follow-up requests, OSM refused to undertake due maintenance on the water mains, resulting in a leak that saturated my apartment through to the ceiling of the apartment below|*![Leak](/atchd/15bff707e8c001eb__image_6483441.JPG__inln.jpg)*|
|**Sep 2017** I returned from overseas to check repair progress and found the Committee trespassed into my apartment and dumped garbage from the street in my master bedroom. I reported the incidents to the police on-line (screenshot available), but the reports could not be accepted. I went to the station and the officers on duty convinced me not to pursue the matter.|*![Dumping](/atchd/15f21c876fd107b5__IMG_6835.jpg__inln.jpg)*|
|**Dec 2017** ALL my personal belongings were ruined. I had moved everything from my apartment into my garage for the duration of the concrete cancer repairs - including clothing, electronics, furniture, art and antiques I'd collected since childhood. When I noticed the pipes in the garage were dripping, I write to OSM 4 times and discussing the problem at two general meetings. I was completely ignored and felt chronically ill-treated.|*![Leather jacket](/atchd/160de651cc16e4c4__2017-03-28-IMG_4743_crop.JPG)*|

The personal property damage, financial losses, stress and anxiety from not knowing
where to sleep each week became too heavy. By xMas time, Strata had left me a half
repaired concrete shell unable to start my renovation. They refused to share the
engineering reports and contractor correspondence outlining the structural integrity of
my floor. I had no idea where I was standing, so I decided I would sue the Committee
and O'Niell.

I laid temporary mats in one room, ordered a temporary mattress, setup a desk and
knuckled down to prepare a case. In the meantime, with no bathroom, in 2018 I have been
showing using a hose on the balcony. I can't even keep the balcony clean because the
failing roof waterproofing floods the brickwork and tiles with dirty debris every time
it rains which doesn't drain properly because the storm water pipe was left half
excavated and busted.

Every single time I shower or even go to the toilet, I am exposed to outside cold/
rain. This is my daily living situation. It's emotionally very draining.

## The "Incident"

On top of the grime a combination of ants, caterpillars and cockroaches regularly come
down from the rooftop to hang out in the decaying masonry and even in my one temporary
bedroom. Our building is not diligently pest treated. Neighbors even had termites in
their garage.

![Termites](/img/termites.jpg)

On *Dec 20, 2017* and again on *Dec 22, 2017* I emailed OSM asking to organize for the
rooftop and other common areas to be treated.

Like the time OSM let my floor flood until it leaked through the ceiling below and
allowing my personal belonging to be ruined from dripping garage pipes, I was ignored.

A couple months later, I noticed what were identified by my doctor's pathology lab to be
cockroach eggs, all around my apartment. They had burrowed tunnels through walls
in-between rooms. They had also burrowed into the double layer brick walls separating my
apartment from the neighbors and into the service stacks housing the water mains and
storm water pipes.

I had been feeling unwell since moving into the building in 2015 and was particularly
off Jan-Mar 2018. In April 2018 I was diagnosed by a US specialist with Chronic Lyme
Disease. Being subjected by Strata to all the above nonsense and not able to maintain a
clean, healthy environment brought huge unnecessary additional day to day stress and
complication to personal health.

### The Correspondence

The following forked email thread took place between the Committee chairperson appointed
mid-December 2017 and John O'Neill of O'Neill Strata management who decided it
worthy to report to the police.

## Police interaction

5 days passed before I heard via my father, who heard from my uncle, who was told by
a member of my Strata Committee that John O'Neill had reported me to the
Police. I had no idea what about or how I could be "the villain" after the things OSM
had done. At first, learning John claimed I threatened to shoot him with a gun didn't
click. When I realized, removed far from realistic context, the phrase ***"Pull the
trigger"***, commonly used by professionals my age (particularly in tech) was culprit, I
barely took the situation seriously. The first costly mistake on my part.

![Pull the trigger Google results](/img/474-ptt-google.png)

### Called to the station

I was eager to as quickly as possible remove all doubt surrounding the hyperbole
misinterpretation and false accusation. My dad and I immediately visited Waverly
station to speak with Constable Junior, the office handling John's report. I'm
certain things would not have unfolded as they did, had I been able during this visit
to answer Constable Jr's questions with my father present and at my side.

On the morning of Sunday, 25th of Mar 2018, I received a call from Constable Jr
requesting to come to Bondi Station. Still in a rush to get things off my chest and
nonchalantly confident that the truth was straight forward and would prevail,
I immediately made my way to the station. When I arrived I met Jr and was
asked to take a seat alone with him in a small room. Looking back, I was naively
off-guard. Being my first encounter of this nature, I was inexperienced and far too
unprepared to handle the unanticipated deceptive agenda beneath what I assumed would
be a reasonable, unbiased exercise in clarifying the truth surrounding the exchanged words.

### The "Pre-recorded" conversation

**Jr.** Asked how I was

**Me.** I answered along the lines of *"I had not been well and was chronically
frustrated with the situation in my home. Having no floor or proper place to shower,
the situation was negatively impacting my day to day comfort and ability to manage
health."*

**Me.** I started getting into how I was feeling about O'Neill Strata Management.

**Jr.** Stopped me in my tracks *"I can see you are frustrated and emotional about this
experience, let's hold it there, I want to focus on asking a few questions".*

**Me.** I wanted and made a point to let Jr. know that I did not have the full context
of what was going on or why I had been called to the station. I requested he explain to
me what allegations were being made and by whom. To elaborate on what I was asking, I
explained that *"I am entangled with O'Neill in a civil/Strata dispute and had already
spent significant time and resources familiarizing myself with with Strata law and the
different civil courts... With Strata, you had to refer to specific clause from
specific act like the Strata Schemes Management Act or the Property Stock and Business
License Act, that had being breached."*

Jr. had a printed copy of the final messages exchanged with myself and John O'Neill.
So I asked specifically to understand on what grounds was I being questioned, because the
only information I had was that a phase I had used, “Pull the trigger” had been taken
way out of context ignoring the rest of the email in which it appeared, and re-imagined
as having something to do with using a gun to shoot someone when neither words, "gun" or
"shoot" were ever previously communicated by myself to any related party. Nor did I own
or had ever shot a gun.

**Jr.** deflected answering my request for context by taping the printed email open handed bringing my focus to his agenda *"We can talk about that in a bit, but first I want to ask you questions about this".*

\`\`\`
Re: SP 13385 - Ants

Pathology of the Infectious Diseases department at St Vincents has confirmed these
to be sacks of Cockroach eggs. They are know to cause Asthma and Eczema and various
other ailments.

You may choose to ignore me again, but it will be shown in court, you have been warned
these things have burrowed through boundary walls.

This isn't a game. Your fucking incompetents leaving the rooftop membrane leaking
for multiple years and consistently fumbling strict maintenance duty is fucking
up people's health.

I'm coming for you the second I'm feeling healthy enough to pull the trigger.
\`\`\`

**Me.** Feeling uncomfortable with a physically printed skewed perspective of the
situation, I tried to boot my laptop to have balancing material handy. I needed a power
socket. I asked Jr. if I could plug in my laptop and he said "no". Then I asked if
there was a wireless Internet connection I could use and he said there was no WIFI
available. I tried to show one or two things on my cracked iPhone, but it was futile so
I requested an email address where I could submit evidence after I'd gone home and had
time to collect relevant items.

Jr. was a probationary officer and he did not do a good job at explaining the severity
of the situation. To the contrary, he outright ignored framing the circumstances. I had no idea:

1. I could be charged solely on the hand-recorded questions he asked next.
2. My request to submit evidence was being ignored and signing his questions, I would not have a fair opportunity to submit material supporting my story.
3. Instead of uncovering truth, his primary goal was to come as close as possible to admitting a crime I didn't even know existed, regardless of my innocence.
4. Officers would play word-smith preparing a "Full facts" report, chopping and bending sentences and language to confuse what was actually said.

Before we proceeded, Jr. made clear the questions I was about to answer
"could be used as evidence". If he had made clear they could completely comprise ground
to be charged, I would have been on higher alert. I was extremely confident the
evidence I would follow up with and submit would speak for itself.

I most definitely answered everything "truthfully", but I didn't answer things
"comprehensively". I didn't want to waste Jr.'s time. The best example, was the question
"Who was the email intended for?". At first I hesitated and said it's complicated. Then
I answered the simplest truth, "I intended John O'Neill to receive and read it". What I
didn't answer was I also expected other staff at O'Neill to receive and read it
since the address I sent the emails to was not a personal email address, but actually a
customer service contact address and I also expected the email to be forwarded to the
Strata Committee, which happened most times I emailed O'Neill and in this instance as
well.

### The "recorded" conversation

My recollection of the hand-recorded part of the encounter was along the lines of:

**Jr.** How long have you known John O'Neill ?

**Me.** Approximately 3 years.

**Jr.** How many times have you interacted?

**Me.** Hundreds of emails

**Jr.** Who was the email you sent intended for

**Me.** It's complicated... I guess I intended John O'Neill to receive it.

**Jr.** What was the intention of your email

**Me.** That I didn't want him to forget I was going to sue him shortly.

**Jr.** Did you intent to cause John significant harm?

**Me.** Can you clarify what you mean by harm? I was intending to sue him.

**Jr.** Did you intent to cause John significant harm?

**Me.** I mean perhaps significant financial harm. Certainly not any physical harm.

**Jr.** Did you intent John to feel threatened?

**Me.** I guess... that's the point of saying you are going to sue someone.

**Jr.** Did you intend to follow through on your threat.

**Me.** I'm 100% pursuing litigation.

At the end of the questions, Constable Jr read back the questions and answers to me.
Nothing seemed untrue. But by no means did I see the interview as an accurate
representation of events, in terms of completeness.

I asked him if I'd made it clear I had no violent intent and Jr. confessed to
me that he did not believe I was violent.

He asked me to sign the questions as a "true" record, which I interpreted
signing that I had answered his questions truthfully to the best of my ability.

I had stated for the record, that I did not have any violent intent and that my only
plan was litigation and that it wasn't breaking the law to tell someone why you were
suing them (in my case for putting the health and safety on occupants in my building at
risk). I was expecting things to be over momentarily and that evidence probably wouldn't
be required to show I was not breaking any laws.

Constable Jr left the room and in came his senior, who confessed Constable Jr was in
training and wanted to know what I thought. I answered that he conducted himself like
"a champion". I signed that I didn't think or was aware that the questioning had been
conducted unfairly. Unfortunate looking back, since a moment later I would realize I
clearly didn't understand what was going on. I honestly thought the interview would be
impartial and unbiased in this type of situation.

### Post-"recorded" exchange and ignored follow ups

The senior office left the room and Constable Jr. re-entered after a few moments. Then
he said *I'm probably going to charge you for "Threat of serious harm over carriage
service."*

My jaw dropped.

Immediately I freaked out and said, *"hold on, I'd like not to exchange another word
until the senior officer from before and my father is present. I obviously have no idea
what is going on and have misinterpreted the situation completely. If anyone has been
harassed it's me by John O'Neill and the Strata Committee."*

Constable Jr left the room to grab the senior office who came in before, but he was
busy, so a different senior office came in and immediately started aggressively
screaming at me.

3 times I timidly asked the Senior Constable to lower his voice. All I remember him
screaming in an intentionally intimidating manner was *"Get out of here, I've
got better things to do with my day than deal with you."* The Irony of the situation was
very concerning. The Senior Constable felt I didn't deserve the respect to be heard and
explained the situation fairly, to avoid being falsely charged and possibly jailed for 7
years for threating behavior and it was ok to aggressive scream in my face and ignore my
requests to tone down his behavior so we could conduct a conversation and I could
understand what had and was going to happen.

When he finally cooled off and Constable Jr began explaining that I would get a notice
to attend court, I protested to him that he failed to explain to me the
allegations being brought against me at the beginning of our meeting. His reply made me
realize how deceptive the whole interaction had been. He said *"As if I'm going to tell
you what you're being charged for"* clearly shedding light, that he thought he was doing
a good job in how he was being trained to conduct the questioning.

I then protested that it was irresponsible to consider phrases in isolation discarding
the fact that in the context of the email it directly followed discussion about
taking O'Neill to court and that the phrase had commonly accepted meaning having
nothing to do with firearms.

The Senior constable challenged me on the spot and said *"yeah like what?"*. I
replied, *"I work in tech and we would use that phrase before sending a push
notification or email campaign to a customer base".* He completely dismissed my argument
as if I had made it up on the spot and insisted the only possible meaning for the phrase
was to shoot a gun.

Over the next few days, my dad tried to contact Constable Jr. I called and left a
message with Officer Symington for Constable Jr. to submit additional evidence and a
Lawyer called twice. We were all ignore ignored.

On advice that the interview was taken by notebook and the matter seemed like a small
issue likely to disappear, I decided not submit a formal complaint. I went to the US
for a month to see medical specialists. When I got home and checked my mail, a
notice to attend court was waiting.

## Charge

I received notice to attend court and defend an incredibly serious bogus charge brought
against me for using "carriage service" *(email)* to "threaten serious harm", where
"victim feared for safety".

With up to 7 years in jail by false conviction, I lost plenty of sleep over what to do with the prejudicial garbage presented as full facts from a naively unsuspecting and inexplicably misleadingly "investigative" questioning
carried out by the police.

https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2006C00305
\`\`\`
474.15  Using a carriage service to make a threat to cause serious harm

  A person (the first person) is guilty of an offence if:

  (a)  the first person uses a carriage service to make to another person (the second
       person) a threat to cause serious harm to the second person or a third person;
       and
  (b)  the first person intends the second person to fear that the threat will be
       carried out.

### Prior verbiage

**3 separate conversations from MY work emails** showing myself and
other people using the phrase "Pull the trigger" without violent intent

### My intent

I had told O'Niell I was suing him in writing more than 10 times. An NCAT application has
been submitted. A lot of evidence is available showing my intent including sending
lawyers to O'Neill's office to inspect the Strata records in January.

### Prior harassment

#### Over email

I had asked O'Neill to stop emailing me repeatedly, but throughout January O'Neill
insisted he continue to email and attempt to argue with me.

#### In my apartment

I have violent threats by the building contractors in writing/email that are the result
of O'Neill and the Strata Committee's conduct in refusing to properly repair my apartment.

### Skewing of context

Imagine on a holiday in the USA, someone had recorded you complimenting a person's "thong(s)" and before you know it, you find yourself accused of Sexual Harassment.

You claim *"All I wanted was to know where they bought their shoes"*. To complicate what seems an obvious misinterpretation to you, folks in the USA are more sensitive on sexual equality than what you've been exposed to back home. After explaining what seemed a straight forward misinterpretation nonsensical to associate with you, you realized the context needed considering to appreciate your view. After all you said "thongs" not "thong". In your mind, even if you'd been aware of the difference in cultural perception of "thong" to be a *"skimpy pair of knickers like a G-string."*, the accusation couldn't add up, because people don't wear more than one. However,
for reason you can't comprehend or fathom as fair, in supposed "Full facts" for a judge to accept as the truth, the language was sliced exact to optimize a certain point of view. The 's' is gone and "thong" is in-fact the topic to be discussed.

Looking at the available evidence with a few moments of warranted patience for convicting someone mistakenly of criminal offense, I will explain how the presented "Full facts" sheet does not soundly add up.


### Wordplay & omitting primary fact

There are countless problems in construction of the allegation. To start:

**I am not, nor have I ever demonstrated violent and harassing behavior or intent.**

The fact sheet ignores my testimony that my exclusive intension of the email in question was to pursue litigation.

Conviction requires
- (a) proof of intent to cause serious *(physical)* harm and;
- (b) intent to cause the recipient(s) fear that the threat will be carrier out

The fact sheet inconclusively states, that I made full admission to sending the email
and intending John O'Neill to receive it and perceive I would follow through on my
intent. But it negligently omits I made the admissions along with confirmation to taking legal action and no other form of action.

The other amazing representation in the fact sheet is that it says the email states
\`\`\`
"This isn't a game. Your fucking incompetents leaving the rooftop membrane leaking for
multiple years and consistently fumbling strict maintenance duty is fucking up people's
health. I'm coming for you the second I'm feeling healthy enough to pull the trigger."
\`\`\`
I.e. it completely dumps the prior sentence and context
\`\`\`
"You may choose to ignore me
again, but it will be shown in court, you have been warned these things have burrowed
through boundary walls"
\`\`\`

I did not admit intent to send only half of the email, which is what the full facts
insinuates. Nor that I warned Jr. that considering the phrase in isolation completely
out of reasonable context was inappropriate and biased. The full facts almost 180
degrees, misrepresents my exchange with Constable Jr.

This is what I was trying to convey the actually meaning when looking at the whole email
and not two sentences chosen to be re-imagine with new meaning.

> Pathology of the Infectious Diseases department at St Vincents has confirmed these to be sacks of Cockroach eggs. They are know to cause Asthma and Eczema and various other ailments. <ins>my concern for the problem: O'Neill Strata management's conduct is compromising  our building's health and SAFETY</ins>

> You may choose to ignore me again, but it will be shown in court, you have been warned these things have burrowed through boundary walls. <ins>explicitly discusses my intent to attend to pursue the matter **via court**</ins>

> This isn't a game. Your fucking incompetents leaving the rooftop membrane leaking for multiple years and consistently fumbling strict maintenance duty is fucking up people's health. <ins>Expresses their legally bound conduct as a serious matter in breach of  their duty.</ins>

> I'm coming for you the second I'm feeling healthy enough to pull the trigger. <ins>is my intended time-line</ins>


## Not allowing submission of evidence

If the policeman would have given me a chance, I could have down him the whole email
thread which actually has me explicitly mentioning to the new chairperson, that
***I've been too sick to submit my NCAT application***.

The Irony of everything is that the actual email thread is about my concern for
health and safety of occupants in the building, which John O'Neill is demonstrating
he does not care for. But he clearly worries about his own "safety". Additionally
the police had no concern for the fact I mentioned I wasn't feeling well at the
beginning of my interaction with Constable Jr.

I have invested literally months preparing to recover financial losses
by learning Strata legislation and researching recent NSW Strata case law. It makes
no sense, that I would compromise this path with violent acts that could harm my
chances of recovering financial losses.

This isn't the first time John O'Neill has defamed me publicly as demonstrated
in his labeled me "unfinacial" to all my neighbors when I'd paid my levies. He is not
a truthful man and I am able to demonstrate other instances of him providing
misinformation.

<!-- 5
biased conduct and skewed standard of
proof that could pass for warranting the police to go ahead with a charge.


6 Threatened with legal action by the Strata agent for emailing a committee member that they should step down because they had mismanaged $1M+ of Owners Corporation funds.

This is what it is like dealing with OSM: [set:stopgap]
 -->

<!-- ### Incorrectly alleged violent or harassing intent

a. Sentences preceding (giving meaning not personally imaged and logically proving violent intent a nonsensical interpretation),
b. The nature and content of the whole email thread (explicitly highlighting litigation as intent and coloring O'Neill misconduct)
c. The emails I was planning to submit as evidence offering clarity around choice of language, the nature of the email thread itself and long history of prior misconduct
 -->

<!-- > ## Summary
*Each point is enough to introducing reasonable doubt.*
1. **Unsound re-imaged meaning** of partial message
  - Cultural consensus on "Pull the trigger" definitions and usage
  - I intended sending the whole email not half, one phrase or a single sentence
  - Illogical implications of pick and choose quoting
  - Actual word by word contextual intended meaning of my own email
2. **Ignoring prior explicit declarations** to litigate (seek resolution within the law)
3. **Vast prior non-violent conduct** in chronic extenuating Strata dispute
  - Using "carriage service" and Internet for proposed innovative Strata solution
  - Hyper vigilant interest in law, Strata legislation and recent Case law/verdicts
  - Focus on recovering of financial losses suffered by Strata maintenance failure
4. **Examples of O'Neill conduct**
  - Pattern of misinformation and false claims against my name
  - Disregard for laws
  - Disregard for occupant health and safety
 -->
<!-- ### An unsound interpretation
 -->
<!--
##### The entire thread chronologically

The first important fact of the timeline is O'Neill ignored my my correspondence and concern for pest control, which they are contractually and legislatively responsible to answer as part of Owners Corporation Secretarial duty and duty to not causing nuisance or compromising Safety of occupants.
 -->
<!-- #### Prior conduct during Strata dispute

##### My background and conduct

[Personal Context](jk) will quickly help you see technology, commerce, creating wealth and innovative software concepts using "carriage service" and always been my only intent. I admit, frustrating [circumstances at home](lot36) have been hard not to express. My [Strata dispute resolution skin](resolution) is thick. In the context of hundreds of hours invested on non-violent optimistic acts, it's clear, course language is just frustrations and stress.

##### False allegations stacking up

##### John O'Neill conduct

5. The allegation was exceptionally unfair, in context that if anyone had being harassed, I could demonstrate circumstance and more literal evidence of such incidence against me by related parties.

So I shall demonstrate the unsoundness of this view one step at a time:

"your fucking incompetents" refers to the company O'Neill ... not John exclusively.
