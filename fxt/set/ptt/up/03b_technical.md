33   Evidence given by police officers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)  Despite section 32, in any criminal proceeding, a police officer may give evidence in chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer.
(2)  Evidence may not be so given unless:
  (a)  the statement was made by the police officer at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers, and
  (b)  the police officer signed the statement when it was made, and
  (c)  a copy of the statement had been given to the person charged or to his or her Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel a reasonable time before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution.
(3)  A reference in this section to a police officer includes a reference to a person who, at the time the statement concerned was made, was a police officer.

50  Proof of voluminous or complex documents
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1  The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the party may adduce evidence of the contents of 2 or more documents in question in the form of a summary if the court is satisfied that it would not otherwise be possible conveniently to examine the evidence because of the volume or complexity of the documents in question.
2  The court may only make such a direction if the party seeking to adduce the evidence in the form of a summary has:
  a  served on each other party a copy of the summary that discloses the name and address of the person who prepared the summary; and
  b  given each other party a reasonable opportunity to examine or copy the documents in question.
3  The opinion rule does not apply to evidence adduced in accordance with a direction under this section.

55  Relevant evidence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1  The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.
2  In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to:
    a  the credibility of a witness; or
    b  the admissibility of other evidence; or
    c  a failure to adduce evidence.

57   Provisional relevance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1  If the determination of the question whether evidence adduced by a party is relevant depends on the court making another finding (including a finding that the evidence is what the party claims it to be), the court may find that the evidence is relevant:
  a  if it is reasonably open to make that finding, or
  b  subject to further evidence being admitted at a later stage of the proceeding that will make it reasonably open to make that finding.
2  Without limiting subsection (1), if the relevance of evidence of an act done by a person depends on the court making a finding that the person and one or more other persons had, or were acting in furtherance of, a common purpose (whether to effect an unlawful conspiracy or otherwise), the court may use the evidence itself in determining whether the common purpose existed.
