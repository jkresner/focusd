(2)  ...admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were ... unlikely ...truth of the admission was adversely affected.

135   General discretion to exclude evidence

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or
(b) be misleading or confusing, or
(c) cause or result in undue waste of time.



141   Criminal proceedings: standard of proof

33   Evidence given by police officers

(1)  Despite section 32, in any criminal proceeding, a police officer may give evidence in chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer.
(2)  Evidence may not be so given unless:
  (a)  the statement was made by the police officer at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers, and
  (b)  the police officer signed the statement when it was made, and
  (c)  a copy of the statement had been given to the person charged or to his or her Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel a reasonable time before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution.
(3)  A reference in this section to a police officer includes a reference to a person who, at the time the statement concerned was made, was a police officer.

//43  Prior inconsistent statements of witnesses///
(1)  ...witness may be cross-examined about a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness whether or not:
   (a)  complete particulars of the statement have been given to the witness, or
   (b)  a document containing a record of the statement has been shown to the witness.
(2)  If, in cross-examination, a witness does not admit that he or she has made a prior inconsistent statement, the cross-examiner is not to adduce evidence of the statement otherwise than from the witness unless, in the cross-examination, the cross-examiner:
   (a)  informed the witness of enough of the circumstances of the making of the statement to enable the witness to identify the statement, and
   (b)  drew the witness’s attention to so much of the statement as is inconsistent with the witness’s evidence.
(3)  For the purpose of adducing evidence of the statement, a party may re-open the party’s case.


(9)  If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:
    (a)  is adduced by another party, and
    (b)  is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made.
    
    

103   Exception: cross-examination as to credibility
(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.
(2)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to:
   (a)  whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and
   (b)  the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.
