//43  Prior inconsistent statements of witnesses///
(1)  ...witness may be cross-examined about a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness whether or not:
   (a)  complete particulars of the statement have been given to the witness, or
   (b)  a document containing a record of the statement has been shown to the witness.
(2)  If, in cross-examination, a witness does not admit that he or she has made a prior inconsistent statement, the cross-examiner is not to adduce evidence of the statement otherwise than from the witness unless, in the cross-examination, the cross-examiner:
   (a)  informed the witness of enough of the circumstances of the making of the statement to enable the witness to identify the statement, and
   (b)  drew the witness’s attention to so much of the statement as is inconsistent with the witness’s evidence.
(3)  For the purpose of adducing evidence of the statement, a party may re-open the party’s case.


(9)  If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:
    (a)  is adduced by another party, and
    (b)  is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made.
    
    

103   Exception: cross-examination as to credibility
(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.
(2)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to:
   (a)  whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and
   (b)  the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.
