### Why a complaint wasn't made

- I previously had no outcome from complaining
  - Wonder if this prosecution is about putting me in my place
- Charge wasn't laid
- I received advice that because a notebook it wasn't serious
- I didn't find out I was charged until I came back in May.

138   Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence
(1) Evidence that was obtained:
(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or
(b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,
     is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:
(a)   did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or
(b)  made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.
(3)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:
(a)  the probative value of the evidence, and
(b)  the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and
(c)  the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and
(d)  the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and
(e)  whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and
(f)  whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and
(g)  whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and
(h)  the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.

### Using records of conversations
It is not true that police only use written statements as evidence in court. 
They can and do use records of verbal conversations. 
They do this especially in summary (rela­tively minor) matters, because in serious matters they must 
comply with strict rules about the recording of statements
to make them admissible ( __Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 281__)

### Special caution for serious offences 
When a person has been arrested for serious offences carrying a maximum penalty of five years jail 
or more the police can give a special caution advising the person that their silence or failure 
to mention certain facts may be used against them in court. 
Before any negative inference can be drawn in court the special caution must be given when their 
lawyer was present ( Evidence Act , s 89A). Special cautions cannot be given to young people under 18.

### How the caution may be used in evidence 
A written statement or recorded interview taken in the police station will end with questions about:
 • whether or not a caution was given and understood
 • whether the statement or interview an­ swears were made voluntarily. 
If the case goes to court, the police may use evidence that they gave the caution to show that what an accused said, was said freely and voluntarily

#### The police code of conduct and ethics 
The police code of ethics and standards of professional conduct (available on the NSW police website) 
sets out the ethical and other obligations and responsibilities of NSW police. 

They are not legal rules and do not confer rights.  If they are not followed, however, a complaint should be made (see Chapter 9, Complaints). 

The con­duct of police could cast doubt on whether any admis­sion or confession was voluntary.

##### An employee of the NSW Police Force must

1. behave honestly and in a way that upholds the values and the good reputation of the NSW Police Force whether on or off duty
2. act with care and diligence when on duty
3. know and comply with all policies, procedures and guidelines that relate to their duties
4. treat everyone with respect, courtesy and fairness
