### Why a complaint wasn't made

- I previously had no outcome from complaining
  - Wonder if this prosecution is about putting me in my place
- Charge wasn't laid
- I received advice that because a notebook it wasn't serious
- I didn't find out I was charged until I came back in May.


33   Evidence given by police officers

(1)  Despite section 32, in any criminal proceeding, a police officer may give evidence in chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer.
(2)  Evidence may not be so given unless:
  (a)  the statement was made by the police officer at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers, and
  (b)  the police officer signed the statement when it was made, and
  (c)  a copy of the statement had been given to the person charged or to his or her Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel a reasonable time before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution.
(3)  A reference in this section to a police officer includes a reference to a person who, at the time the statement concerned was made, was a police officer.

//43  Prior inconsistent statements of witnesses///
(1)  ...witness may be cross-examined about a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness whether or not:
   (a)  complete particulars of the statement have been given to the witness, or
   (b)  a document containing a record of the statement has been shown to the witness.
(2)  If, in cross-examination, a witness does not admit that he or she has made a prior inconsistent statement, the cross-examiner is not to adduce evidence of the statement otherwise than from the witness unless, in the cross-examination, the cross-examiner:
   (a)  informed the witness of enough of the circumstances of the making of the statement to enable the witness to identify the statement, and
   (b)  drew the witness’s attention to so much of the statement as is inconsistent with the witness’s evidence.
(3)  For the purpose of adducing evidence of the statement, a party may re-open the party’s case.






(9)  If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:
    (a)  is adduced by another party, and
    (b)  is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made.











85   Criminal proceedings: reliability of admissions by defendants
(1)  ... an admission made by a defendant:
   (a)  to... an investigating official ... performing ... investigation ... possible commission, of an offence, ...
   (b)  as a result of an act of another person ..., ...defendant...believed..., capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought ...
(2)  ...admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were ... unlikely ...truth of the admission was adversely affected.
(3)  Without limiting ... (2),... take into account:
   (a) ...condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education... to which the person ... appears ... subject, and
   (b) ...admission ... made in ... questioning:
     (i)  the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put, and
    (ii)  the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the person questioned.






90   Discretion to exclude admissions
... criminal..., ... court may refuse to admit ...admission, or... evidence to prove... particular..., if:
(a)  ...adduced by... prosecution, and
(b)  having regard to... circumstances...admission was made,...unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.





103   Exception: cross-examination as to credibility
(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.
(2)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to:
   (a)  whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and
   (b)  the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.



135   General discretion to exclude evidence
The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:
(a)  be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or
(b)  be misleading or confusing, or
(c)  cause or result in undue waste of time.

138   Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence
(1)  Evidence that was obtained:
(a)  improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or
(b)  in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,
     is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.
(2)  Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:
(a)  did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or
(b)  made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.
(3)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:
(a)  the probative value of the evidence, and
(b)  the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and
(c)  the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and
(d)  the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and
(e)  whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and
(f)  whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and
(g)  whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and
(h)  the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.


141   Criminal proceedings: standard of proof
(1)  In a criminal proceeding, the court is not to find the case of the prosecution proved unless it is satisfied that it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
