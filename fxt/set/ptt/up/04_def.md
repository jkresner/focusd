    1. /assumed that .* Police are alleging .* content of .* email would cause a reasonable person in the ‘shoes’ of the victim to fear serious injury; that is, fear that you would ‘come after him/her and “pull the trigger”’/

    > The above elements of the offence make it clear that a threat must be made. If we assume that a threat was made in respect of ‘pulling the trigger’, the Police would still need to prove that you in fact intended the victim to fear that the threat will be carried out. This means that stating the above with no intention to cause fear to the victim, nor any intention that the threat will actually be carried out is not enough to establish this element.

    > even though your attention was never brought to the exact part of the email which is threatening, you note that you intended to send the email as a reminder that you were suing him, and that you sent it out of frustration. You have also had many arguments with the victim prior, so this is not a once-off, surprising ‘threat’ to the victim.

    > John O’Neill is the alleged victim. He concedes that over the years you have had issues with your unit, and notes that you believe that he is not doing his job as the Strata Manager, especially in relation to leaking pipes, cockroaches and insects. He concedes that emails had been previously exchanged between you and him, and that nothing had been done to address these issues
    > victim alleges that you called him ‘incompetent’ and that you would ‘pull the trigger’ once you felt better. 
    > In respect of how the email made him feel, we note the victim alleges that the email was “confrontational” and “frightening”. He stated that he believes that he “has fears for his safety and the safety of his staff” (see page 2 of statement). He stated that he felt physically threatened by the phrase “pull the trigger”, and that he was worried due to your use of this phrase. He states that at no point did he give you permission to intimidate or harass him the way you allegedly did.

    > TREVOR I would run it on Tuesday and 
      1. get the strata manager to admit the problems with the unit over a prolonged period; and
      2. get the police to admit no threat of fire arms, no evidence of use of them; and 
      3. the explanation given by you is consistent with innocence that they have not negatived. 
      4. You need to give some evidence in the witness box of what you meant; and 
      5. your history of lyme disease and what your words meant at the time.
      6. need to acknowledge they are capable of a double meaning and apologise - but;
      7. you have proceedings underway and never intended to harm anyone.

      1. Stay focussed on the accusations and avoid tangents. 
      2. Explain in basic, unemotional terms why you were angry with the strata manager, a few sentences no more. Don’t make this about the justice of the strata issues - it’s purely about the email/stalking charge. 
      3. If they ask about the quantity of emails or the tools, explain that while it’s not something everyone would do, it’s not at all unusual for people in our industry, especially entrepreneurial types who believe in facts-based problem solving.
      4. Have a clear and simple explanation of what your words meant - each and every part of the phrase the police have highlighted - break it down and have an explanation ready for each bit - especially about what decisive action you intended to take once you were well.
      5. As you were clearly having a dispute, drops-in suggestion that this appears frivolous or vexatious litigation - designed to annoy and harass you rather than genuine fear of harm or any expectation that an offence would be proven.

      > Simon and I view there is a case to answer. 
      1. On its face the email you sent to Mr. O’Neill contains a threat. Even though you told Police that your intention, when sending the email to, there is an argument available to the prosecution that ‘intention to cause Mr. O’Neill to fear serious harm’ can be inferred from the email itself - the prosecution ordinarily infers intention from conduct.
      2. I view that you should give consideration to defending the charge because of the onerous fault element.
      3. If lesser charge under 474.17 - a lower fault element of recklessness because the Magistrate might well find that sending an email in those threatening terms would give rise to an awareness of a substantial risk that the recipient of the email would fear serious harm.
      4. In your favour 
        (i) the strict fault element of intention in the current charge 
        (ii) the fact that you have in fact sued O’Neill 
        (iii) you do not mention a gun in the email 
        (iv) you do not have a gun 
        (v) you could not sue O’Neill if you shot him 
        (vi) your co-operation with Police and the fact that in your interview with Police you stated that your intention was to sue O’Neill, and you have in fact done so and 
        (vii) the fact the expression “pull the trigger” is also commonly used as a metaphor.
