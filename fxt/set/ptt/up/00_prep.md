[Chapter 7: Court procedure]
----------------------------------------------------------

### Putting things on the record

The first thing to remember about your first appearance … an important opportunity to put things on the record. For example, … tell the magistrate at the earliest possible opportunity if:

    - …
    - you have a complaint;
    - …
    - …
    - …

If you don't … that 'failure' may be used against you later to cast doubt on your claims.


### Court protocol

Whenever you speak … you are expected to stand ….… In New South Wales, both are now called 'Your Honour'. … stand up when a magistrate or judge enters … no need to bow, as lawyers do.

… basic politeness is wise…, but don't degrade yourself. The magistrate does have the power in her or his court to have people arrested and charged for 'contempt of court' – for offensive or disruptive behaviour … even if you don't like the magistrate, you … have to convince to treat you fairly.

Police prosecutors and lawyers stand behind the 'bar table' … when presenting their arguments, or asking questions of witnesses. If you represent yourself, stand next to the table unless, or until, the magistrate invites you to stand behind the table. As an unrepresented …, … magistrate is supposed to assist … with … basic procedures, such as asking … if you'd like to ask a witness … questions. (… research properly, … have … questions prepared …!)

…


[Chapter 8: Pleas]
----------------------------------------------------------

### Considering the implications of a guilty plea

… If there are inaccuracies (including possible errors over past convictions), make sure you point them out to police and to the magistrate. Make a formal 'objection' to the magistrate if an inaccurate 'fact sheet' is presented.


### When should I plead guilty?

However, if the case against you looks bad, … You can still argue factors in 'mitigation' – circumstances that may be taken into account to reduce the penalty.

…

However, where you have a reasonable defence, and do not believe you did anything wrong, then it is not necessarily the case that you will receive a greater penalty if you are found guilty. To the contrary, pleading guilty in these circumstances may suggest that you knew you did the wrong thing, and so you are inviting a harsh penalty.

As a general rule, do not plead guilty to a charge if you believe, after due consideration of all the facts, that you have not done anything wrong.

### When should I plead not guilty?

Plead not guilty … if you believe, after due consideration of all the facts… have not done anything wrong. Also … you believe … charge is inappropriate or excessive.

… your right to defend any charge laid against you, … by law (Australian law and international human rights law) … entitled … presumed innocent until proven guilty; … police … media may not … share this view.

… advantages of pleading not guilty:

- … prosecution … 'put to proof' – … must prove your guilt, and you must have … benefit of any reasonable doubt;
- you remain in a morally strong position and can be more assertive of your rights through the entire process;
- you have a chance of acquittal – if … acquitted … clear of the charge and no conviction is recorded.

The disadvantages of pleading not guilty are:

- … hearing … witnesses giving evidence against you; … may be long and stressful;
- … need to prepare and take 'time out' for what might be … prolonged … battle;
- if you are not eligible for legal aid, you will either need to spend a good deal of extra time yourself in preparation, or pay a lawyer substantial amounts of money; the costs will be greater than those for a guilty plea.




[Chapter 9: Hearings and trials]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
…

### Hearings

A hearing before a magistrate is sometimes called a summary hearing, because it is decided straight away, or 'summarily'.

In a summary hearing you might not receive any advance warning of witnesses or evidence to be called. However, you are entitled, well before the hearing, to a statement of alleged 'facts' on which the prosecution is basing its case. This statement should let you know what you must answer. From this information you can consider which parts of the prosecution case you should investigate, as well as whether you wish to call any witnesses. If … prosecution … in court departs radically from … statement of 'facts' …, you are entitled to ask for an adjournment, to further investigate these new 'facts'.

…

For contested matters … basic processes … is outlined …


1. Plea
   - A formal plea is asked for: guilty or not guilty.
2. Prosecution case
   - The prosecution opens, outlining its case to the court.
   - Prosecution evidence is then called, generally through witnesses. 
     The defence may then cross-examine these witnesses; 
     the prosecutor may then re-examine each witness.
   - The defence may then submit that there is no case to answer.
3. Defence case
   - The defence opens, and outlines its case.
   - Defence evidence is then called, 
     which may then be cross-examined or objected to by the prosecution. 
     The defence may then re-examine each witness.
4. Closing addresses
   - The prosecutor gives the first address, to the magistrate or jury (or judge alone).
   - The defence gives the second address.
5. The verdict
   - … given by the magistrate
6. Sentencing
   - If there is a plea or finding of guilty, the magistrate or judge moves to sentencing. 
     Here the prosecution and defence may again call witnesses, who can be cross-examined.


The central issue in a criminal hearing or trial is always whether or not the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. No person has to prove her or his innocence. The law presumes a person, before and during trial and after acquittal, to be innocent. This principle is not always respected by police and the media, but it is the law and it is a fundamental common law right. If a person is found not guilty, she or he is free to leave the court.

### Committals

For more serious charges, a committal (or preliminary) hearing is held in the Local Court to decide whether or not the prosecution has a case to go to trial in a higher court. This is a place to test the prosecution evidence, but generally not to go all out to discredit it. This would be a wasted effort as most matters do proceed to trial.

When you are facing a serious charge, the prosecutor must give you a list of prosecution witnesses and copies of their statements at some stage prior to the committal proceedings. This is called the prosecution's 'brief' of evidence. After reading these statements, you have to decide which persons you want to question. You must then give the prosecution notice of whom you wish to question or cross-examine, so they can be called as witnesses. If you don't want to question any of them, there will simply be a 'paper committal', where the magistrate decides on the basis of the written statements whether you have a 'case to answer', and so whether the matter should go to trial.

If you are charged with an offence involving violence, there is a prohibition on the cross-examination of any alleged victim in committal proceedings, unless there are 'special reasons'. This may influence your decision over whether to elect for a 'paper committal'. If you have no conflict with the evidence of the police but only with that of the victim, for example, you may consider a paper committal. If you want to contest police evidence, however, you can make use of the opportunity to cross-examine them at the committal. To be able to cross-examine other witnesses you may be asked to provide substantial reasons.

On the odd occasion where the prosecution cannot prove an element of its charge, you will be discharged at the committal stage. For example, in a drug case the prosecution may not be able to show continuous possession, that is, they cannot prove that the drugs subsequently analysed were the same substance found on you. In another example, if you have extremely strong evidence that you were in a different place when the charged crime was committed, you may choose to call this evidence. However, unless you are certain you will beat the charge, only give defence evidence at a committal as a last resort.

There's also usually little point in a dramatic attack on a prosecution witness at a committal. You should make it clear to a witness if you are saying she or he is not telling the truth, but save your 'big guns' for the jury. If you have any surprises, keep them in reserve for the trial. It's usually best, tactically, not to reveal all details of your defence at the committal. Also there's usually not much to be gained by calling defence witnesses – they can wait for the trial.

Use a committal to discover things about the prosecution evidence. Use subpoenas to get access to police records (see Preparation), and plan to question witnesses to draw out information. You can also make objections to evidence you consider to be inadmissible (see Evidence).


[Chapter 10: Preparation]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] collect evidence rapidly;
[ ] obtain charge details;
[ ] research the law;
[ ] consider your defences;
[ ] investigate the prosecution case;
[ ] use subpoenas; and
[ ] apply to have the charges dropped.


### Collect evidence early

Make sure to also obtain:

- a doctor's written record (and photographs, if possible) of any injuries you may have suffered;
- photographs or videos of any of the circumstances leading to your arrest; and
- any physical evidence, for example, documents

... collect ... statements of ... witnesses, ... Get their statements, not promises ...

...

### Obtain Charge Details 

... obtain ... important details from ... prosecution, asap:

1. charge sheet – ... the charge precisely, and generally give a 'statute reference';
2. particulars – ... 'facts' sheet ... precisely you are meant to have done; 
3. brief – ... prosecution witnesses' statements.

...

The name of the arresting officer, or at least the charging officer, should appear on the charge sheet and the 'facts' sheet. If not, ask... If ... particulars ... appear to be missing, ask the prosecutor... or ask ... when you're before the magistrate. 

If adequate particulars are not provided, request an adjournment until they are... entitled to know exactly what you will be required to answer at your hearing...


### Research the law

Once you have a copy of the charge sheet and the particulars, you can look up the relevant law... For NSW offences you may be dealing with the [Crimes Act 1900], the [Bail Act], the [Evidence Act] and the [Summary Offences Act 1988]. For offences under Commonwealth legislation look at the [Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914], the [Criminal Code 1995 (Cth)] and the [Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)]..

... Acts of Parliament (or statutes) must be **observed to the word** by the courts, so pay attention to their exact wording. Each offence listed in an Act carries with it important details:

    the elements of each offence (there are often two or more issues that have to be proved to establish the offence); and
    the maximum penalty for the offence.

Once you have this statutory information, you will need to look at what common law applies. The common law, or judge-made law, is made up of cases that have interpreted the statutory law. For this information you'll need to go to the Commonwealth and State law reports, but useful summaries are contained in some basic law manuals. The most valuable of these are loose-leaf services, which are updated as legislative amendments are made and usually spell out the elements of each charge.

If, for example, you have been charged with obstruction, you need to identify each major element of the charge. The prosecution needs to prove each major element beyond reasonable doubt. Legally, your task in defending the charge is then to establish a 'reasonable doubt' about at least one of these major elements. The charge sheet could look something like this:

That Mary Brown at Marrickville, Sydney, on the 23rd day of September 2005, intentionally obstructed Constable John Plodd, a member of the police force, in the due execution of his duty.

Break this charge down into its essential elements, as follows:

1. That Mary Brown at Marrickville, Sydney, on the 23rd day of September 2005 …

The prosecution has to prove this beyond reasonable doubt – but usually the details of person, place and date are accurate. If not, the prosecutor can usually amend it (with the court's permission) unless the trial and evidence has proceeded on a different basis for some time.

2. intentionally obstructed Constable John Plodd

The prosecution has to prove this beyond reasonable doubt – and this may well be the most contentious issue.

3. a member of the police force

This is probably not an issue – but the prosecution must still prove it.

4. in the due execution of his duty

The prosecution also needs to prove this beyond reasonable doubt – and this is also open to attack. Was Plodd acting unreasonably? Unlawfully? The prosecution must prove that he was acting 'in the due execution of duty' and not on some individual venture of his own.

You will need evidence – either through cross-examination of prosecution witnesses (for example, by questioning John Plodd) or by calling your own witnesses – to support your challenge to the elements of this charge.

Where possible when researching the law, seek advice from experienced lawyers, as there is a web of interrelated Acts, common law and rules of practice. It is here that case law may be helpful. You might be able to find judgments that have considered behaviour similar to Constable Plodd's to be unreasonable, or outside the execution of duty. These judgments can be quoted in support of your case.


### Consider your defences
While the central part of a defence is to knock down, or rather cast doubt on, the elements of the charge(s), there are also some common law and statutory defences that you can raise. A little research is required to see which would be most valuable to argue. The following are some possible options:


### Common law defences
These are defences 'at large', which may be applied to defend one's actions against all sorts of charges. Defences make actions lawful, which otherwise would not be. They include:

    self-defence (now a statutory defence in New South Wales, for some offences);
    insanity (unfit to plead);
    mental illness;
    necessity;
    reasonable or lawful excuse;
    duress; and
    claim of right (for example, you did not intend to steal something but believed you owned it).

In addition, two defences:

    diminished responsibility; and
    provocation,

may mitigate the penalty or reduce a charge of murder to the lesser, alternate charge of manslaughter.

In the example above, Mary Brown could argue that she had every right to be out on the street in Marrickville at a demonstration, and that it was the police who created trouble. If she had also been charged with 'assaulting police', she may like to argue that any contact with the police was by way of self-defence.


### Statutory defences
An offence contained in an Act of Parliament will sometimes have a particular defence written into it, such as 'without lawful excuse' or 'without reasonable excuse'. If this is the case, you may like to argue that you had a 'reasonable excuse', and you would typically need to prove this 'on the balance of probabilities' (that is, more likely than not). You need to check the Acts from which the statutory charges come. Case law may also be helpful. You may be able to find cases similar to yours where 'reasonable excuse' was successfully argued.

...

### Investigate the prosecution evidence
When you have the particulars of the charge, and even more importantly, the statements of prosecution witnesses, you are able to check the facts asserted in those statements. You can ask a friend or a lawyer to interview prosecution witnesses. The prosecution does not 'own' its witnesses, and they are able to speak to anyone. However, it may be better for the person charged not to directly approach them, in case a suggestion is made that they are being intimidated. The prosecution witnesses might be able to provide information that may help your case, as much as it may help the case of the prosecution.

If you have been committed for trial, contact the District or Supreme Court Registry and ask for a copy of the 'depositions' from the committal (that is, the transcripts of evidence). These should be provided free of charge. Also ask for a copy of all exhibits tendered at the committal, and a copy of the proposed indictment. The prosecution may change the wording of the indictment between the committal and trial, but if they do so they must give you a copy.

As with collecting evidence from your own witnesses, take steps to investigate prosecution evidence as soon as possible. The more you know about the prosecution case and their witnesses, the more informed your questions will be at trial.

You can investigate prosecution witnesses' assertions by questioning other witnesses about the same events, or by looking at documentary records of those events. Some records are available for the asking, but there is also a process (the issuing of subpoenas) by which you can demand that specified documents be produced to the court.


### Use subpoenas
Being before the court on a charge allows you to use some of the authority of the court to force disclosure of evidence. For instance, you may wish to subpoena (call for) a police officer's notebook, to check against her or his statement; or you may subpoena police, governmental or private records relating to an action you were involved in.

A subpoena may also require that a person appear in court to give evidence, or to produce relevant documents. It may, however, be risky to subpoena people to give evidence if you don't have a statement from them – you cannot predict the evidence they will give, and it may not all be helpful to your case.

A court official or lawyer will tell you how to fill out a subpoena, which must be stamped by the Clerk of the Local Court or Registrar. Courts also usually have a filing fee, which you have to pay unless you have legal aid or a low income. You, or someone on your behalf, must then physically 'serve' the subpoena on the party from whom the evidence is required (that is, deliver it to her or him personally). You should keep a record of when and by whom the subpoena was served, in case it is denied that a subpoena was received. Subpoena return dates should be well before the hearing or trial date, to allow time to check any information they might disclose.

In court you will have to 'call on' the subpoena, that is, ask for the person to produce the documents, or produce herself or himself to give evidence.

Be careful in drafting a subpoena. It must be for some 'legitimate forensic purpose', relevant to the charge. If it is not precise enough (too wide or too vague) then it may be ruled invalid, and you will have wasted your time and money.


### Apply to have the charges dropped
Police have a discretion (subject to the scrutiny of the court) to withdraw a prosecution. An application may be made to the Officer in Charge, Prosecution Office at the Regional Headquarters of the region involved in the matter. The officer will consider these criteria:

    the triviality of the offence;
    the character of the defendant;
    any demonstrable error of fact or law on the part of police; and
    any psychiatric or medical issues.

In practice though, once a charge is laid, prosecutors generally only consider whether or not they can prove the charge.

In more serious matters, prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, a prosecution may be 'no billed' (that is, not prosecuted) even after it has been committed for trial. In this case the application is made to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. In your application you may like to point out the weakness of the prosecution evidence against you (if it is weak) or indicate the existence of powerful defence evidence. However, don't give away too much of your defence case. If you do go on to trial, for tactical reasons, you may wish to save some surprises for the prosecution.

Representations for charges to be withdrawn, or for matters not to proceed to trial, may require adjournments of several months while they are being determined. Notice that adjournments will give you more time to prepare your case, if the charge does proceed.

Applying for a stay of proceedings (that is, a temporary or permanent suspension of the case) is another means of avoiding a trial. You can apply to the court for a stay, for example, on the grounds that the prosecution is an abuse of process. You can also apply for a quashing of the indictment, on the grounds that on the facts stated, an offence is not disclosed.

Other applications that may be made before a trial include an application for orders for a separate trial, or for a separation of the counts (if there are multiple charges). For example, if you are charged with several robberies, you can reasonably argue that you would face great prejudice before a jury if all charges were heard together. The jury might be so suspicious that they would convict, even if the evidence were thin on each count.








Costs

If a summary charge against you is dismissed, or you are discharged at committal, you can apply to the magistrate for an order for costs. The magistrate has a discretion to order the informant (usually the police) to pay you 'just and reasonable' costs.

The court might not award costs in your favour if your conviction is set aside on appeal unless it is satisfied that:

- the investigation was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner;
- the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith, or were improperly conducted by the prosecutor;
- the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate, or to investigate properly, a relevant matter, of which it was or should have been aware, and the court suggested that you might not be guilty or that the proceedings should not have been brought; or
- because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the prosecutor's conduct of the proceedings, it is reasonable and just to award costs to you.

In New South Wales, you may be able to apply for a certificate under the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW)]. This scheme is broader, in that it applies to persons who are acquitted from either a summary or indictable offence, and the grounds for awarding costs are not as strict.




[Going to court: guide to the Local Court for defendants]:
==========================================================
----------------------------------------------------------


### In the courtroom...

If you do not have a lawyer the Magistrate will ask you a number of questions. When answering, you should address the Magistrate as “Your Honour”.

The first questions you are likely to be asked are:

    Are you ..........? (your name)
    Do you have a lawyer representing you?
    Do you wish to have your matter dealt with today?

The Magistrate asks this question to see if you are ready to deal with your case or need an adjournment for an appropriate reason, eg to get legal advice. You would usually be given one adjournment if you ask for it.


### On the day of the hearing

The police will present their case first. They will call their witnesses to give evidence, for example the police officer in charge of your case (also sometimes called the 'OIC') and any other witnesses. After each witness gives evidence, you or your lawyer have the right to cross-examine (question) them about their evidence or about other matters relevant to your case.

After the prosecutor has called all of their witnesses you are entitled to give evidence (if you want to) and to call witnesses. Generally, if you choose to give evidence,you would be the first defence witness to give evidence. The prosecutor is likely to cross-examine (question) you. Then you can call your witnesses. After each one gives evidence the prosecutor can cross-examine them. Each witness must wait outside the court room until it is their turn to give evidence. Make sure your witnesses are at court on the day of the hearing to give evidence in person.

After all witnesses have given evidence the prosecutor may make submissions to the magistrate about why you should be found guilty of the offence. You can then make submissions, that is, tell the court why you should be found "not guilty" based on the evidence.

The Magistrate, after hearing both the police and defence case will decide either that:

    Your case is dismissed, which means you are free to go and you have been found not guilty, or
    You have been found guilty. If this happens the Magistrate will then consider the penalty.
