1. Following recent correspondence between the parties our client instructed us to commence legal recovery action against you pertaining to outstanding levy contributions and related costs under the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015.  You will certainly be given an opportunity to defend those proceedings should you wish to do so and the process by which that can be attended to is explained on the Statement of Claim which is the originating Court process setting out the background to the claim and how the amounts sought are calculated.

2. We would invite you to agree to accept service of the afore-mentioned Statement of Claim by email, which is an accepted mode of service, by agreement between the parties.  In this respect we would be please if you would advise us of your agreement to do so within seven (7) days from today.

3. If agreement cannot be reached for service by email, our client would be entitled to file a further Court process, known as a Notice of Motion, seeking orders for this mode of service and would have no option but to see to recover from you the costs of that application, should that be necessary.  Our client would instruct us to rely on the contents of this communication if the need arises to do so.

4. We await your response within seven (7) days from the date hereof and thank you in advance for your co-operation.

Dear Sir,  

It is a matter for you how you choose to treat our communications in this matter.  That is unless we expressly mark such communications as private and confidential.  

Our instructions are not to communicate with you in the form of debating the matters you have raised. You will be given the opportunity to defend any legal recovery action in due course.

I am not concerned about your costs as I believe neither myself or the OC will ultimately be liable to cover them.

Please be advised, I have received notices of nature from O'Neill not of personal interest via email ("We're moving" and others). I have also once received an Agenda/supporting meeting documents.

With this in mind ask you reasonably to clarify as to avoid you wasting you own time following instructions you've received:
m1. What is meant by "not set up" in the context of having receiving notices. 
already. 
2. How lacking capability is grounds to ignore legislated requirements surrounding Service Address?

If (2) were acceptable:  
- Could people argue they don't need to pay people because they ran out of money?  
- In good faith could you acknowledge I didn't capability to receive post because your clients kicked me out of my service address at the beginning of 2017?

Our enquiries indicate that your lot account is already set up to receive levy notices by email.  Our enquiries further indicate that O’Neill Strata Management’s processes are not currently set up to provide electronic service of notices of meeting, agenda’s or minutes of meeting, however this is a service which the strata management company is working towards providing to its strata schemes in the near future.  Accordingly, those types of documents continue to be served on lot owners by post at their nominated address for service of notices. We are further instructed that the managing agent has advised you of this on previous occasions.

Our instructions are that no change of address for service of notices with respect to your postal address has been received by our client from you, and accordingly, your address for service of notices (other than the electronic service of levy notices) remains as Kepplegate, Unit 36/37 Paul St, Bondi Junction NSW 2022.

As referenced in our earlier email, if you require a change to your lot’s address for service of notices to be effected to the OC’s strata roll, then please provide written confirmation of same.

Otherwise, we believe the OC’s position as regards the arrears pertaining to Lot 36 has been made clear, and we reiterate the terms of our email to you of 22 Aug 2018.

Please be advised that any cause to communicate with you further on this matter only increases the OC’s legal costs, which would be sought from you.  We hope to avoid this.

Please note, I am aware of this requirement and I'm letting you know the failure to comply to it is one of many that I will not only defend this ledger on, but raise in concern over the full integrity behind the authority and funds given to you to pursue these demands and further action.

There is a requirement for an Australian address for service of notices to be recorded on the OC’s strata roll.  
We will forward your email below to the OC’s managing agent for attention however.
