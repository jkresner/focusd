| AFFIDAVIT DETAILS | |
|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name          | Jonathon Kresner
| Address       | jkresner@gmail.com  0412 327 121
| Occupation    | Software Developer
| I say         | on oath OR affirm 
|               | 1. I am the judgement debtor
|               | The reason why these proceedings should be transferred to NCAT:
| 1. | The matter is already part of an existing proceeding received by NCAT 12/4/18, File No: SC 18/18166
| 2. | Resolution was attempted by the Defendant via AGM Agenda item and Fair Trading mediation. In both instances the plaintiff ignored the defendant and failed to discuss the matter at General Meeting with owners present.
| 3. | The defendant indicated prior to 27/09/2018, the matter would be dealt with at NCAT in context of intertwined Strata Schemes Management breaches/contraventions.
| 4. | Vexatiously filing the proceeding in Local Court 3 days prior to hearing of a criminal proceeding from false claim by the plaintiff attempting to nullify civil liability is an unfair attempt at subjecting the defendant to financial disadvantage.
| 5. | Tribunal is the quickest and cheapest avenue for resolution of the real issues underlying this proceeding. Failure of administrative and capital works fiduciary duties, disclosure and misuse of funds by the Strata Committee and Strata Agent. 
| 6. | After the defendant's lot has now been uninhabitable for 2 weeks, amongst compliance with levy estimation guidelines, the defendant is seeking orders from NCAT to vary the contributions amount and interest allegedly owed.
| 7. | If the matter remains in Local Court, the same issues and extensive collection of evidence must be heard by multiple judges at cost to NSW taxpayer. 
| 8. | Not only have the defendants legal fees been unnecessarily spent by skipping the multiple less formal dispute resolution attempts by the defendant, but unfairly the defendant ends up paying whether the matter is defended successfully or not! |
| 9. | The defendant is suffering a chronic illness (Lyme disease) and is struggling with typing (carpel tunnel) and should be left to focus via the main NCAT proceeding on getting their home back after the Plaintiff rendered their residence uninhabitable. |
