    Part 12    Disputes and Tribunal powers
===============================================================================

> __Introductory note.__ This Part gives power to the Tribunal to make orders to settle disputes about certain matters relating to the operation and management of a strata scheme. It also contains general provisions about the powers of the Tribunal and some other order-making powers of the Tribunal.

> Initially, an application for an order is processed by the registrar. The registrar must refuse to deal with a matter if satisfied that mediation was appropriate and was not attempted.

> A person may either apply to the Secretary for mediation of a matter or make other arrangements for mediation. If mediation of a matter is unsuccessful or a matter is not appropriate for mediation, the registrar may accept the application for the order.

> The following table describes the types of orders that may be made and who may apply for them.
