focusD 
==================

> *Express perspective and see other peoples.*

Pronounced "focused", *focusD* helps convey understanding, 
interpretation and intent surrounding any digitized source material. 

1. If you originally authored or contributed to a report, 
conversation, blog post or say photo(s). It might help at a later
point in time to further elaborate and add context behind what you
were thinking.

2. If you are consuming complex information, focusd can be helpful to
keep track of things like what you thought were the most important
details.

3. At the heart, focusd was built with the primary object to help parties
understand each other. You could use it to compare study notes with
friends or arguments a case to a judge.

### Basic concept

You're already familiar with **bold** which signals readers
to pay "more" attention. **bold** is limited in that it can't express 
which is "most" important between **X** and **Y**.

### Next-level empathy explorer
 
**focusD** provides annotation features and styles to constrain 
reader attention. It's great at influencing the order which information 
is consumed. Use it to markup one source at a time or push the limits
drawing complex creative relationships between multiple sources in tandem.
