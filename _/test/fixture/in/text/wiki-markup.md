> Except from [wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language](wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language):

> In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating
a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.[1]
The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts,
i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue
pencil on authors' manuscripts. In digital media, this "blue pencil
instruction text" was replaced by tags, that is, instructions are expressed
directly by tags or "instruction text encapsulated by tags." However the
whole idea of a mark up language is to avoid the formatting work for the
text, as the tags in the mark up language serve the purpose to format the
appropriate text (like a header or the beginning of a paragraph etc.).
Every tag used in a Markup language has a property to format the text we write.

>> Examples include typesetting instructions such as those found in troff, TeX
and LaTeX, or structural markers such as XML tags. Markup instructs the
software that displays the text to carry out appropriate actions, but is
omitted from the version of the text that users see.
