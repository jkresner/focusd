Why focusd? 
====================

Human knowledge is exponentially expanding. Every year we need to consume and
communicate more information. 

Its harder to keep up and easier than ever to interpret data differently... 
especially words! 

## Challenge

<!-- Constrain reader attention -->

- Establish immediate credibility 
  - Clear
  - Relevant 
  - Adequate context
- Word limitations
  - Picture tells 1000 words
    - Tell 100 stories from a picture 
  - Emotions / sensations
  - Quantum empathy
- Connect enough dots
  - Anticipate gaps
    - Knowledge
    - Unshared experience
    - Divergent experience (personalization)
    - Forgetfulness
  - Meet minds
    - Baseline assumptions
    - Referenced interpretations
- Avoid misinterpretation
  - Reader motivations
  - Multiple meanings
  - Domain filters  
  - Cultural mistakes
  - Publishing errors

### Current tools

High quality software that functions as intended often comprises many 
multiple more testing than implementation code that effectively 
constrains how the creators logic can be utilized.

With language we still rely on manual editing, sometimes peer
reviewed. Besides being inadequate to address infinite complexity of addressing
all the hurdles, testing/editing are available only before publishing. 

Unfortunately we always become aware of issues after.

## Back story

Sometimes, one sentence or in my case three words is all it takes.

Unresolvable differences boil down to not being able to see another's
perspective. In long disputes, without something like focusd it can be
impossible even to express ones perspective. The worst scenario is
when parties begin mis-projecting intent in an ongoing vicious cycle.
Eventually if a 3rd party mediates, sides are rewarded on presentation 
and negotiation skills instead of historical behavior. 

focusd is an empathy tool designed to close gaps with optimistic hopes to
stop divergence before dialog ends.
