Pathology of the Infectious Diseases department at St Vincents has confirmed these to be sacks of Cocoroach eggs. They are know to cause Asthma and Eczma and various other ailments. 

You may choose to ignore me again, but it will be shown in court, you have been warned these things have burrowed through boundary walls.  

This isn't a game. Your fucking incompetents leaving the rooftop membrane leaking for multiple years and consistently fumbling strict maintenance duty is fucking up people's health.  

I'm coming for you the second I'm feeling healthy enough to
