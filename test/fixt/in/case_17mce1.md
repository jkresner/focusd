## JUDGEMENT

1. **BASTEN JA**: I agree with the orders proposed by White JA, for the reasons he gives. In particular I agree with the statement at [67] below that the case does not require consideration of the strength of the presumption against statutory interference with common law rights. It is worth saying why that is so.

2. The clear statement principle, often sourced in *Potter v Minahan*, [1] is not to be read as a presumption that legislation does not abrogate or alter common law rights, absent irresistible clarity. Such a presumption would be a bizarre fiction. In fact, O’Connor J did not use language so loosely; rather, in a lengthy extract from *Maxwell on Statutes*, he included the statement that it would be “in the last degree improbable that the legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness.” It is doubtful that, given the surrounding expressions, “infringe rights” should be given a broad and unconfined reading.

3. If one construes that phrase as including any laws which infringe the existing rights of individuals, whatever may have been true in 1908 has little traction today. As McHugh J noted in *Malika Holdings Pty Ltd v Stretton* [2] “nearly every session of Parliament produces laws which infringe the existing rights of individuals.” That statement was cautiously expressed, even in 2001. With respect to claims for damages in tort, it is hardly necessary to identify the extent to which statutory modifications have, over the years, varied the common law in all the separate jurisdictions of Australia and New Zealand.

4. It is also important to bear in mind that “common law rights” do not exist in the abstract. The rights in question relate to protection of property. More particularly, they relate to the protection of a kind of property which is a statutory creation. It would not have been in any degree improbable if Parliament had set out to establish a separate scheme for regulating losses suffered by lot owners as a result of the conduct of the owners corporation of strata lots. However, it did not do so; all that matters for the present case is that s 226 of the *Strata Schemes Management Act* 1996 (NSW) was inconsistent with any suggestion that the scheme for dispute resolution provided by Ch 5 was an exclusive code governing disputes between lot holders and the owners corporation.

5. **WHITE JA**:   This is an appeal from orders of the Equity Division made on 10 November 2016 (Young AJ) that the plaintiff’s proceedings be dismissed with costs (*McElwaine v The Owners – Strata Plan No.* 75975 [2016] NSWSC 1589). The plaintiff was the registered proprietor of a lot in a strata plan for an apartment building in Newcastle East. The defendant is the owners corporation in whom the common property is vested. The appellant sued the owners corporation claiming damages in nuisance. He alleged that the owners corporation had failed to repair waterproofing defects in the common property to prevent water penetration to his unit. The parties agreed on the determination of a separate question in the nature of a demurrer, namely:

    > “Whether the legal effect of Chapter 5 of the Strata Schemes Management Act is that the plaintiff has no remedy against the defendant in common law nuisance in respect of the claim pleaded in the proposed Further Amended Statement of Claim.”

6. The primary judge reframed the question and determined that:

    > “… the SSM Act operates so that the plaintiff has no remedy against the defendant in common law nuisance in relation to the claim pleaded in the proposed further amended statement of claim.”

    Accordingly, his Honour dismissed the proceedings.

7. An objection to the competency of the appeal was not pressed. Because the final order dismissing the proceedings was made consequentially upon the determination of a separate question, leave to appeal is not required by s 103 of the *Supreme Court Act 1970* (NSW) (*National Employers Mutual General Insurance Association Ltd v Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Ltd* (1989) 17 NSWLR 223 at 235, 240; *Tiufino v Warland* (2000) 50 NSWLR 104; [2000] NSWCA 110; *Chief Commissioner of State Revenue v Smeaton Grange Holdings Pty Ltd* [2017] NSWCA 184 at [90]-[94]). There was no dispute that the value of the matter in issue in the appeal was more than $100,000.

8. Since the primary judge’s decision the *Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 (NSW)* has commenced. It commenced on 30 November 2016. It repealed the *Strata Schemes Management Act 1996* (NSW) (“the SSM Act”). As both parties accepted, the correctness of the judgment on the appeal depends upon the proper construction of the *SSM Act* and the *Strata Schemes (Freehold Development) Act 1973* (“the SSFD Act”): *Strata Schemes Management Act 2015* (NSW), Sch 3, Pt 2, cl 7. *The SSFD Act* was repealed by the *Strata Schemes Development Act 2015* (NSW) which also commenced on 30 November 2016.

9.   Because the *SSM Act* and the *SSFD Act* apply to the determination of this appeal I will use the present tense when referring to provisions of those Acts.

10.  The respondent submitted before the primary judge and on appeal that the only positive duty the owners corporation had in relation to the repair of water-proofing defects on the common property was a statutory duty pursuant to s 62(1) of the *SSM Act*. Sections 61 and 62 provide:

    >"**61 What are the key management areas for a strata scheme?**
    >- (1)     An owners corporation has, for the benefit of the owners:
    >- (a)     the management and control of the use of the common property of the strata scheme concerned, and
    >- (b)     the administration of the strata scheme concerned.
    >- (2)     The owners corporation has responsibility for the following:
    >- (a)     maintaining and repairing the common property of the strata scheme as provided by Part 2,
    >- …
    >- (c)     taking out insurance for the strata scheme as provided by Part 4,
    >- …

    >**62   What are the duties of an owners corporation to maintain and repair property?**
    >- (1)     An owners corporation must properly maintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair the common property and any personal property vested in the owners corporation.
    >- (2)     An owners corporation must renew or replace any fixtures or fittings comprised in the common property and any personal property vested in the owners corporation.
    >- (3)     This clause does not apply to a particular item of property if the owners corporation determines by special resolution that:
    >- (a)     it is inappropriate to maintain, renew, replace or repair the property, and
    >- (b)     its decision will not affect the safety of any building, structure or common   property in the strata scheme or detract from the appearance of any property in the strata scheme.

    > **Note.**    The decision of an owners corporation under subsection (3) may be reviewed by an Adjudicator (see section 138).”

11. In *The Owners Strata Plan 50276 v Thoo* [2013] NSWCA 270; (2013) 17 BPR 33,789 (“Thoo”) this Court held that a lot owner did not have an action for damages for breach of the statutory duty imposed by s 62 (at [222]). The reason for that conclusion is that Ch 5 of the *SSM Act* provides the exclusive remedies for breach of the statutory duty imposed by s 62.

12. Section 226 of the *SSM Act* (which is in Ch 7) provides:

    > **“226 Other rights and remedies not affected by this Act**
    >- (1)    Nothing in this Act derogates from any rights or remedies that an owner, mortgagee or chargee of a lot or an owners corporation or covenant chargee may have in relation to any lot or the common property apart from this Act.
    >- (2)    In any proceedings to enforce a right or remedy referred to in subsection (1), the court in which the proceedings are taken must order the plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs if the court is of the opinion that, having regard to the subject-matter of the proceedings, the taking of the proceedings was not justified because this Act or Part 4 of the Community Land Management Act 1989 makes adequate provision for the enforcement of those rights or remedies.
    >- (3)    The defendant’s costs are to be as determined by the court.”

13. The respondent submitted that s 226(1) did not apply because the appellant did not have a right or remedy in relation to his lot or the common property that arose “apart from this Act”. Rather, in the respondent’s submission, the appellant’s claim depended upon his showing a breach of the statutory duty created by s 62, even though it had been framed as a breach of a common law duty.

14. The primary judge accepted these submissions. The primary judge observed (at [9]) that pursuant to s 21 of the *SSFD Act* the owners corporation could not deal with common property, except in accordance with that Act or the *SSM Act*. Section 21 of the *SSFD Act* provides:

   > **“21   Common property to be dealt with only under this Act and the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996**
   > Common property shall not be capable of being dealt with except in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996.”

15. The primary judge cited the following passage from Thoo (at [142]):

   > “… The purpose of s 21 is clearly to preclude any form of action by the owners corporation in relation to the common property that is not contemplated and expressly permitted by the strata titles legislation.”

16. The primary judge observed that this Court has decided that any obligation under s 62 was not one a breach of which would sound in damages (at [13]-[16]) and that the remedies for breach of statutory duty were confined to those contained in Ch 5 of the SSM Act.

17. Section 138(1) of the SSM Act (which is in Ch 5) provides:*

    “*138   General power of Adjudicator to make orders to settle disputes or rectify complaints*
    (1)    An Adjudicator may make an order to settle a dispute or complaint about:
    (a)     an exercise of, or a failure to exercise, a function conferred or imposed by or under this Act or the by-laws in relation to a strata scheme, or
    (b)     the operation, administration or management of a strata scheme under this Act.”

18. Section 123 of the SSM Act provides that a person can apply for an order under Ch 5 if he or she is eligible to make an application in accordance with the provision under which the order may be made. An order under s 138 can only be applied for by an “interested person” (s 138(5) of the SSM Act). That expression is relevantly defined in the SSM Act as follows:

    “*interested person*, in relation to a freehold strata scheme, means any of the following:
    (a)     the owners corporation for the strata scheme,
    (b)     the chairperson, secretary or treasurer of the owners corporation (or of the executive committee of the owners corporation) of the strata scheme,
    (c)     a strata managing agent for the strata scheme,
    (d)     an owner of a lot in, a person having an estate or interest in a lot in, or an occupier of a lot in, the strata scheme.”

19. Provision is made for mediation (ss 125-133). An adjudicator does not have power to make an order for the settlement of a dispute or complaint that includes the payment by one person to another of damages (s 138(3)(d)).

20. Division 2 of Part 4 of Ch 5 contains specific provisions in relation to orders concerning alterations and repairs to common property and other property. Division 3 of Part 4 of Ch 5 concerns orders relating to insurance. Division 4 of Part 4 of Ch 5 enables an adjudicator to make orders including an order varying contributions levied on lot owners.

21. An appeal from an adjudicator’s order lies to the Civil and Administrative Tribunal (s 177). The Tribunal also has jurisdiction if a matter is referred to it by an adjudicator under s 164 and in certain other matters under Division 2 of Part 5 of Ch 5 that are not presently relevant. The powers conferred on the Tribunal under Ch 5 do not extend to the making of an order for the payment of damages.

22. The primary judge considered that s 75 of the SSM Act pointed to a legislative intention that disputes, whether or not they involved a common law right, should be dealt with in the adjudication system in Ch 5 and that damages were not an available remedy (at [22]). Section 75 requires an owners corporation to provide estimates before an annual general meeting of how much money would be needed to be credited to its administrative fund for actual and expected expenditure to maintain the common property and any personal property vested in the owners corporation in good condition on a day to day basis; to provide for insurance premiums; and to meet other recurrent expenses. It also requires an owners corporation to provide estimates as to how much money would need to be credited to its sinking fund for painting or repainting common property; to acquire personal property; to renew or replace personal property; renew or replace fixtures and fittings that are part of the common property; to replace or repair the common property; and to meet other expenses of a capital nature. The primary judge considered that if common law claims for damages by lot owners would have to be met by an owners corporation, then that would completely throw out of balance the scheme for ensuring that there is always a fund available to meet the cost of keeping the building in good repairs. In his Honour’s view this told against a lot owner having a common law cause of action for a matter that would come within Ch 5 of the SSM Act.

23. The primary judge accepted that the appellant’s claim was not one for breach of statutory duty, but rather a claim in nuisance arising at common law. His Honour quoted s 226(1) of the SSM Act and noted the submission of counsel for the appellant that that provision was a clear indication that the appellant’s common law rights to sue in nuisance were not affected because he was not suing for breach of statutory duty. The primary judge observed that s 226(2) tended towards the view that it is possible for a person to commence proceedings for alleged breach of statutory duty or a common law tort of nuisance or negligence and that the only consequence would be that if the matter were covered adequately by the SSM Act the court was prohibited from giving the plaintiff any costs. However, his Honour concluded (at [31]) that:

    > “… it seems to me that in the light of decisions of the Court or Appeal such as Ridis [Ridis v Strata Plan 10308 (2005) 63 NSWLR 449; [2005] NSWCA 246] and Thoo, that one would need to read it [viz. 226(2)] down so that the legislature recognised that there was a possibility that there might be a right of an owner which was not mandated to be dealt with under the dispute proceedings in Ch 5 but which could have been brought under Ch 5 in which case as a failsafe provision deprivation of costs was provided as a disincentive. It seems to me that that is more in accordance with the decisions of the Court of Appeal on the structure of the SSM Act generally than a more expansive view of s 226(2).”

24. The primary judge did not further address s 226(1).

25. The primary judge concluded:

   > “[32]    Although Tobias AJA in Thoo’s case was speaking in terms of an action to enforce a statutory duty, it seems to me that the interpretation of the scheme of the SSM Act taken by the Court of Appeal leads one to the view that the same applies to a common law duty. The SSM Act intends that disputes, whether or not they are also involving a common law right, are to be dealt with in the adjudication system under the Act and not independently.
   > [33]    The thought went through my mind that it is perhaps odd that if a person who was not entitled to bring a complaint under Ch 5 had a claim in nuisance that that claim would be validly considered by a court and, if made out, damages would be awarded which would affect the levies made under the SSM Act. However, after some consideration it seemed to me that this is not a helpful thought because a third parties rights [sic] would be the subject of insurance mandated under the Act and that, in any event, it is extremely difficult to think of such a situation ever occurring. Although there is no direct authority on the point, it seems to me that the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in analogous cases involving claims against the body corporate for breach of statutory duty that the legislature intended that claims by unit holders whether for statutory duty or common law duty were to be dealt with under the Act and that the common law claims are not available. Accordingly, the question posed for my decision should be answered yes. However, it seems to me that the question should be reframed so that the order of the Court is that the SSM Act operates so that the plaintiff has no remedy against the defendant in common law nuisance in relation to the claim pleaded in the proposed further amended statement of claim.”

26. It is critical to the respondent’s case that it make good its contention that it owed the appellant only a statutory duty under the SSM Act in relation to its management and repair of the common property. It is only if that premise is made good that the respondent can rely on the holding in Thoo that Ch 5 of the SSM Act provides exclusive remedies for breach of an owners corporation’s statutory duty as an answer to the appellant’s claim in nuisance, and can argue that s 226 is not engaged on the ground that the appellant cannot rely upon a duty arising apart from the SSM Act. For the reasons which follow I do not accept that premise. Rather, an owners corporation, as legal owner of the common property, may owe a general law duty of care or a general law duty not to create or to abate a nuisance, and not merely a statutory duty that can be enforced only through the mechanisms provided in Ch 5 of the SSM Act. Contrary to the view of the primary judge, decisions of this Court do not support the view that such a general law duty is excluded. To the contrary, the decision in Ridis and in Owners – Strata Plan 21702 v Krimbogiannis [2014] NSWCA 411 proceed on the assumption that such general law duties can exist in addition to the statutory duty of repair. Thoo does not decide to the contrary. Neither the SSFD Act nor the SSM Act negate the rights of a lot owner or occupier of a lot to enforce an owners corporation’s duty in respect of the management or repair of the common property that is owed to an owner or occupier of a lot in that capacity. The appellant’s right to sue at common law is preserved by s 226. Accordingly, in my view the appeal should be allowed.
