    Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units.  
(2) The owners corporation for each strata scheme for part of a building and any other person in whom is vested an estate in fee simple in part of the building that is not included in the parcel of the strata scheme must insure the building and keep the building insured under a damage policy. 
    Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units.  
(3) In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (2), it is a defence to establish that the defendant was willing to join in the insurance of a building under a damage policy but that the policy could not be taken out because another person specified in that subsection was unwilling to join in the application for that policy.  
(4) This section does not apply to an owners corporation for a strata scheme comprising 2 lots if:
(a) the owners corporation so determines by unanimous resolution, and
(b) the buildings comprised in one of those lots are physically detached from the buildings comprised in the other lot, and

(5) A damage policy may consist of one or more policies of insurance.   


#### 161  Requirements for damage policy
(1) __General requirements__  
    The damage policy for a building must be with an approved insurer, be in the name of the owners corporation, and any other person required to insure under section 160 and provide for the following:
(a) the building is to be insured for at least the amount determined in accordance with the regulations,
(b) if the building is destroyed, the building is to be rebuilt or replaced so that the condition of every part of the rebuilt or replacement building is not worse or less extensive than that part when new,
(c) if the building is damaged but not destroyed, the damaged part of the building is to be repaired or restored so that the condition of the repaired or restored part is not worse or less extensive than that part when new,
(d) expenses incurred in removing debris are payable,
(e) the remuneration of architects and other persons whose services are necessary as an incident to the rebuilding, replacement, repair or restoration is payable.   
(2) __Limited sum liability__  
    Instead of providing for work and payments being made if a building is destroyed or damaged, the damage policy may limit the liability of the insurer in that event to an amount specified in the policy. The amount must not be less than an amount calculated in accordance with the regulations.  
(3) __Parts of building to be covered__ 
    The parts of a building to be covered by a damage policy include the following:
(a) ownersâ€™ improvements and ownersâ€™ fixtures forming part of the building,

(3) The Tribunal may, on application by an owners corporation or other person liable to pay a proportion of a premium, determine the replacement value and proportion payable. The determination is binding on each person liable to pay a proportion.  
(4) The Tribunal may, on application by any person liable under this section to pay a proportion of a premium, make an order adjusting the proportion payable by a person to reflect that the use to which a part of a building in which that person has the fee simple is put causes an insurance premium under this section to be greater than it would be if it were not put to that use.   


#### 163  Use of insurance money by owners corporation
(1) An owners corporation that receives money from an insurer for the destruction of or damage to a building must immediately apply that money in rebuilding, replacing, repairing or restoring the building.
