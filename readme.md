focusD ![[https://badgen.net/npm/v/focusd)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/focusd)]
==================

Pronounced "focused", *focusD* helps convey interpretations. Express your perspectives and see other peoples using visual queues.

You're already familiar with **bold** which signals readers
to pay "more" attention. **bold** is limited in that it can't express 
which is "most" important between **X** and **Y**. 

**focusD** provides annotation features and styles that help you 
constrain reader attention and influence the order and context
which information is consumed.
